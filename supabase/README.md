# Legacy schema (frozen)

`supabase/migrations/` is the **old, public-schema database** that today's app code
still reads. It stays here, unchanged, only so that **self-hosters** can run the
current version (README → Self-hosting). No workflow applies it to the shared
OpenAppHub database, and nothing new is added to it. `supabase/scripts/` holds the
demo-account helpers for that schema.

The new schema is `db/migrations/` (schema `charter`, on the OpenAppHub core), applied
by `scripts/migrate.mjs`. When the app switches to it (migration step 9), this
folder is removed and the README's self-hosting steps change to `bun run db:migrate`.

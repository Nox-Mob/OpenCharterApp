# OpenCharterApp roadmap

Where things stand and what's next. Plans: `docs/plans/` (MVP: `wave-a-mvp.md`; Phases 1–3 and later waves: `phases-1-3-review.md`). Epics: `docs/epic.md`. Decisions: `docs/decisions.md`. Testing by hand: `docs/user-testing.md`.

## Pending migrations for Lovable
`0000`–`0035` are applied (0032–0034 on 2026-11-02, with Lovable's confirm migration 0035). Apply the one below (steps and checks in `docs/lovable-handoff.md`).

| Migration | Enables | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `0036_home_chapter_no_chapter_levels` | D-184: below a home-chapter national, chapters can't add or restore membership levels (the screens already hide them; this makes the database refuse it too) | Waiting |

## Now: the MVP release, v0.1.0 (`docs/plans/wave-a-mvp.md`)
Decisions: no automatic email in the MVP (D-169), Playwright end-to-end tests (D-170, D-175), demo data kept until a second real national joins (D-171), version 0.1.0 with a changelog and tag (D-172).

**Sprint 1, done**
- [x] A8 National membership with a home chapter: a national chooses its model once, when it's created (both models compared side by side, or "decide later") or on Settings → General; members pick one chapter or none (or the national's at-large chapter, e.g. an online chapter) and change it whenever they like; chapters list their members with national standing (D-166, D-174, D-176; 0030)
- [x] A3 Payments export: Settings → Payments → "Export payments", for the org or its tree, audited, emails only for member viewers (D-173; 0029)
- [x] A2 End-to-end tests: Playwright harness, CI on pull requests to `main`, first specs (menu by role, view as member, members across chapters, board contact email, Settings → Setup, join-page required questions, test-gateway checkout against a deployed site) (D-175)

**Sprint 2, done** (live: 0032 applied)
- [x] A4 Suggested levels: the national marks levels "Suggest to chapters"; a chapter starts from one and chooses Copy (its own, editable) or Link (follows the national; same price, an amount less or a percentage less, kept within the range), with both explained (D-165, D-177; 0032)
- [x] A5 National standing on the chapter's Members page (separate model, when the national requires its membership); "Actions needed" reminds the member to join or renew the national (D-178; 0032)
- [x] End-to-end specs: a throwaway national created through the screens with the home-chapter model, the chapter wizard, a member picking and changing chapter (`lifecycle.spec.ts`); payments and member export downloads (`export.spec.ts`); suggested levels (`levels.spec.ts`, runs once 0032 is applied). The lifecycle run found a bug deleting home-chapter demo nationals, fixed in 0033

**Sprint 3, done except owner actions** (live: 0032–0034 applied)
- [x] A6 Pricing step in Membership setup: "Prices by member fields", applied by `apply_setup` and matched by rule name, so re-applying updates instead of duplicating (D-177; 0032)
- [x] A7 Members "everyone" view: a "Columns" picker for member fields (remembered per viewer); export across chapters with each org's directory rule and an Organization column (D-179)
- [x] More end-to-end specs: accessibility on every main screen by role (`a11y.spec.ts`)
- [x] R1 security review (`docs/security-review.md`, D-180) · R2 accessibility checks (D-183) · R3 pre-commit hook and docs check (D-182) · R5 `CHANGELOG.md`, version 0.1.0 · R6 large-roster check, `bun run test:perf`; paged lists and 0034 (D-181) · R7 monitoring notes (`security-review.md` §5)
- [ ] **Owner:** A1 live Stripe test-mode run on a non-demo test org (connect, join, webhook, refund; `user-testing.md` §10)
- [ ] **Owner:** R4 receipt wording reviewed by a CPA (R-07), or ship with the placeholder and say so (it's in the changelog)
- [ ] Still to add as end-to-end specs: renewal, Membership and Board setup applied, appointing an officer
- [ ] Release checklist (`wave-a-mvp.md` §6): Lovable applies 0036, full `user-testing.md` pass, add the AGPL-3.0 `LICENSE` file (R-24), pull request to `main`, `v0.1.0` tag
- After 0.1.0 (`security-review.md` §1.6): F1 revoke `has_permission` / `is_org_member` from anonymous callers; F2 and F3 done (D-187)

## After the MVP (`docs/plans/phases-1-3-review.md` §3)
**Wave B: infrastructure**
- [ ] B1 E-08: jobs, scheduled routes, email via `EMAIL_TRANSPORT` (Lovable's email or the client's own server, Settings → Email, send-from address) (D-159), signed-in confirmation page for links (D-164)
- [ ] B2 Lapse handling and renewal reminders (E-13)

**Wave C: money**
- [ ] C1 E-20 postpaid dues, options as inheritable settings (D-161); in the home-chapter model, chapters' local dues
- [ ] C2 E-20 parent orgs invoice subordinate orgs (national fee; Direct payments only, D-162)
- [ ] C3 E-21 PayPal adapter
- E-22 custom domains stay deferred until F-11 (packaging, D-160, D-168) and a hosting decision

**Wave D: Phase 3**
- [ ] D1 E-24 approval engine, with board report review as its first consumer
- [ ] D2 E-25 board reports (types, schedules, submit, review, overdue)
- [ ] D3 E-25 vacancy alerts and national oversight dashboard
- [ ] D4 E-26 document repository
- [ ] D5 E-27 elections (each org chooses first past the post or ranked choice, D-167; private choices, own ballot visible until the next election, admins can view but never change, results after certification, D-163)
- [ ] D6 E-28 automation engine

**Also later**
- [ ] Member overview: all my memberships, membership history, organization info (`phases-1-3-review.md` §6)
- [ ] View as a *specific* member (impersonation with an audit trail): needs a decision and server-side support
- [ ] Receipt templates and manual receipts (E-36)

## Done
### 2026-11-02
- [x] Dependencies refreshed, majors included (D-187); Playwright pinned at 1.64.1 and the test browser hardened: sandbox on, Chrome stable in CI, origin guard (D-186); `bun audit` 29 → 2 moderate (dev tooling)
- [x] Home-chapter model shows only what applies: no chapter acceptance, chapter levels, "must also join" or chapter dues settings and setup questions; chapters have no levels (D-184; 0036 waiting); dues settings reworded for the separate model; no real organization named as an example
- [x] Configuration only in Settings (D-185): Settings → Board settings holds seat terms, contact emails, seat titles, the seats an org defines and the board rules; the Board page shows the board and appoints officers
- [x] Migrations 0032–0034 applied by Lovable; their hand-written types and readiness checks retired
- [x] Sprints 2 and 3 of the MVP: A4, A5, A6, A7, release hardening R1–R3, R5–R7 (above); fixes 0033, 0034
- [x] Choosing the membership model when a national is created, with both models compared (D-176)
- [x] Sprint 1 of the MVP: A8, A3, A2 (above)

- [x] Board setup can change an existing seat's "used by" (D-157, 0027); Rank is required in new Membership setups and at Demo National (0027)
- [x] Board contact emails: per seat, a role email or the officer's own email, never both (D-156, 0026)
- [x] Members page for admins covers everyone in the org and every org below it (chapter admins: their chapter); admins no longer get the Directory (D-154)

- [x] Member overview: Actions needed, Your profile, Your roles and seats, Board and who to contact (D-153)
- [x] Org page: left-hand menu with the admin pages under Settings; overview numbers; Reports for chapter admins (D-152, 0024)
- [x] Board seats used by a national *and* every chapter; changing a seat's "Used by" (D-151, 0024)
- [x] Decisions for later waves: email transport (D-159), packaging (D-160, D-168), postpaid settings (D-161), Direct payments only (D-162), ballots (D-163), approval links (D-164), suggested levels (D-165), voting method (D-167)

## Deferred (user decision 2026-10-30: core first, automations later; E-08 is now Wave B, D-169)
- [ ] E-07: per-org web addresses (subdomain / `/o/$slug`)
- [ ] E-08: jobs + scheduled worker, automatic emails (incl. invitation emails), signed-action tokens
- [ ] E-13 automated lapse job and renewal reminders (manual/derived standing for now)
- [ ] E-08 follow-up: revisit E-12 / E-13 / E-15 for email once email exists (never send for a demo org: check `public.emails_allowed` / `emailsAllowed`, D-148):
  - join and payment confirmation (with the receipt once E-15 exists)
  - "application received" notice to admins
  - approved and declined notices (a decline mentions the refund)
  - renewal reminders before expiry, plus grace and lapse notices
  - payment failed and refund notices
  - invitation emails (today admins copy the link)
  - "claim your record" invites for admin-created members
  - alerts when a Stripe connection fails verification or webhooks stop arriving

## Cleanup before launch
- [ ] Remove the demo data before a second real national is onboarded (D-171; steps in `docs/demo-data.md`)
- [ ] Switch off `purge_smoke_data` in production (D-150) at the same time

# Security and release-readiness review (MVP 0.1.0)

Status on 2026-11-02, for branch `BoardUpdates` with migrations `0000`–`0034`. Covers the Wave A release-hardening items R1 (security), R2 (accessibility), R3 (checks), R6 (performance) and R7 (monitoring) from `docs/plans/wave-a-mvp.md` §5. Decisions D-180..D-183. Re-run the checks in §6 before each release and update this page.

**Verdict: no blocking findings.** Three follow-ups are scheduled after 0.1.0 (§1.6), and two items need the owner (§5).

## 1. Security (R1)

### 1.1 Tenant isolation
Checked against a database built from every migration (the `test:db` setup):
- **All 31 tables in `public` have row-level security on.** 28 of them have `org_id`. The other three are the organizations themselves and the global permission catalogue (`permissions`, `role_permissions`), which can be read but not written through the API.
- **Reads** go through `is_org_member` / `has_permission`, which inherit downward only (D-032). A chapter admin asking for a sibling chapter gets nothing back. This is tested in `db/tests/10_tenant_isolation.sql` and in each feature's tests: 9E roll-ups, 9K payments export, 9L home chapter, 9M standing and levels, 9N roll-up performance.
- **Writes** to sensitive tables go only through `security definer` functions that check permission first. Only two tables have a DELETE policy, and both deletes are intended: `org_settings` (managers remove an override) and `member_segments` (saved views). No history, payment, receipt, term, appointment, pricing-rule or chapter-history table can be deleted from the API. `audit_events` has no write grant or policy at all; triggers and definer functions write it.
- **Member records** (`org_member_profiles`) have no insert policy. A member can't create a record in a chapter or point one at someone else's national membership (`home_of`). Records are created by invitation, joining or an admin, all through definer functions.

### 1.2 Definer functions
There are 129 `security definer` functions in `public`. A scripted pass checked each one. Each falls into one of these groups:
- **It checks the caller first.** `auth.uid()` together with `has_permission`, `is_org_member` or `is_platform_operator`. Examples: `create_demo_organization` and `delete_demo_organization` need a platform operator; `export_payments` needs `payments.view`; `chapter_national_standing` needs `members.view`.
- **It is a trigger.** Triggers can't be called through the API.
- **It is an internal helper revoked from API roles,** such as `profile_membership_id`, `listed_in_directory`, `linked_price` and `sync_linked_level`.
- **It is deliberately callable without signing in,** and these are the only four:
  - `public_join_info` and `public_home_chapter_info`. These return only what a public join page shows: name, levels and prices, required questions, and chapters to pick from.
  - `has_permission` and `is_org_member`. These answer yes or no for a given user and org. Low severity: someone could probe whether a user ID belongs to an org, but user IDs are random UUIDs that aren't published. **Follow-up F1:** revoke both from `anon` in the first migration after 0.1.0. They are used in policies, so check that every policy still evaluates as `authenticated`.

Every definer function sets `search_path = public`, which prevents search-path hijacking.

### 1.3 Session flags
Linked levels (A4, D-177) can only be changed while the database session flag `app.level_link` is set. Only `sync_linked_level`, `adopt_suggested_level`, `set_linked_level_price` and `make_level_own` set it, and they restore the previous value. A client could set the flag itself with `set_config`, but that only gets past the "linked levels can't be edited directly" guard. The caller still needs `membership.manage` on that org under RLS, so all they could do is edit their own chapter's linked level by hand. Accepted: the guard keeps honest clients consistent and is not a security boundary.

### 1.4 Credentials and payments
- Each org's Stripe keys and webhook secrets are sealed with `GATEWAY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and stored in `private.gateway_secrets`. The `private` schema is not exposed through the API, and only `service_role` can use it. Server functions unseal them on the server only, and the browser never sees them.
- Webhooks are verified with the org's signing secret before anything is recorded. Already-handled events (`webhook_events`, unique per gateway event) are ignored, so replaying an event does nothing.
- Return links after paying use the app's public address (D-158), never one taken from the request. Payments are also confirmed from the return page by asking Stripe, so a forged return URL can't mark a payment paid.
- No secrets are in the repository. `.env` only holds the publishable Supabase key.

### 1.5 Exports and audit
- Member exports and payment exports write their audit event inside the same database call that returns the rows (`log_member_export`, `export_payments`), so there is no export without a log entry.
- Payment exports include emails only where the exporter may see that org's members (D-173). Member exports follow each org's directory rules (D-139, D-179).
- CSV cells that start with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` are escaped, so a spreadsheet won't run them as formulas.
- Viewing an individual ballot (Wave E, not in the MVP) will be audited (D-163).

### 1.6 Dependencies
`bun audit` on 2026-11-02 reported 29 advisories (1 critical, 14 high, 13 moderate, 1 low):

| Where | Packages | Risk to us | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lint, format, build and dev-server tooling only | `shell-quote` (critical), `brace-expansion`, `js-yaml`, `minimatch`, `launch-editor`, `nanoid`, `source-map-js`, `esbuild`, `vite` 8.1.5 | None in production: none of these ship in the built site. The dev-server ones matter only when running `bun run dev` on an untrusted network | Accepted for 0.1.0 (D-180). Refresh with `bun update` as part of F2 |
| Runtime: server-side rendering | `seroval` 1.6.8 (through `@tanstack/react-start` 1.168.60) | Moderate. The advisories need attacker-made RegExps or typed arrays in data the server serialises; we serialise query results (strings, numbers, dates) | **F2 done (2026-11-02):** TanStack Start 1.169.4 brings `seroval` 1.7.6 |
| Test browser | Playwright 1.64.1 bundles Chromium 156.0.8078.4, behind Chrome stable's late-October security fixes; Playwright's sandbox is off by default | Low for us: tests visit only our own app and backend | Pinned at 1.64.1 by the owner and hardened (D-186): sandbox on, CI on Google Chrome stable, an origin guard that blocks every other host |
| Runtime: form validation | `zod` 3.25.76 (fixed only in 4.6.6) | Low. The advisory is about memory use when validating oversized constrained collections; our schemas cap lists (for example, at most 10 conditions per pricing rule), and the database rechecks everything | **F3:** move to zod 4 after 0.1.0. It's a major version, which touches every schema and `@hookform/resolvers` |

## 2. Accessibility (R2)
- **Automated** in `e2e/a11y.spec.ts`, as National, Chapter and Member, on the dashboard and every main screen (Overview, Members or Directory, Board, Reports, Chapters, Settings, Levels, Payments):
  - every button, link, field, combobox, checkbox, switch, radio, tab and menu item has an accessible name (WCAG 4.1.2, 1.3.1)
  - each page has one main heading and a language (2.4.6, 3.1.1)
  - sign-in works by keyboard alone, with a visible focus ring (2.1.1, 2.4.7)
  - **Result: all pass.**
- **By design:** the components are Radix-based (shadcn/ui), with keyboard support, focus trapping in dialogs and ARIA roles built in. Dialogs have titles. Toasts are announced. Tables use real `th` headers.
- **By hand** (`docs/user-testing.md` §16), before release:
  - colour contrast in light and dark themes
  - every flow at 200% zoom and phone width
  - a screen-reader pass of join and checkout

## 3. Checks before code lands (R3)
- **Pre-commit hook** (`.githooks/pre-commit`; install once with `bun run hooks:install`). It runs:
  - lint
  - formatting
  - types
  - migration rules
  - unit tests related to staged files
- **"Docs check" job in CI** for pull requests: code or migration changes need a docs or test change, or the label `no-docs-needed` (D-182).
- Database tests, build and end-to-end tests stay in CI.

## 4. Performance with a large roster (R6)
`bun run test:perf` (needs `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, like `test:db`) seeds a national with 20 chapters and 5,000 members, each with a membership and a payment, then times the heavy reads as the national admin. Budget: under 1 second each (D-181).

| Read | Before | After 0034 |
|---|---|---|
| Overview numbers (`org_overview_stats`) | 1,050 ms | 156 ms |
| Reports: members by chapter (`org_rollup_members`) | 1,347 ms | 77 ms |
| Reports: revenue by chapter (`org_rollup_revenue`) | 5 ms | 5 ms |
| Members "everyone" view (profiles plus memberships under RLS) | 428 ms | 372 ms |
| Directory of one chapter (`member_directory`) | 129 ms | 8 ms |
| Payments export across the tree (`export_payments`) | 68 ms | 69 ms |

Laptop-class Postgres 16; the hosted database will differ, but the ratios hold. Two fixes came out of this:
- **Inherited settings resolved per row.** Grace days, and the directory's listed-by-default setting, were resolved once for every member row. Migration 0034 resolves them once per organization; `db/tests/9N_rollup_performance.sql` checks that each membership still uses its own org's grace days.
- **Lists truncated at 1,000 rows.** The API returns at most 1,000 rows per request, so a single chapter's Members page, the directory and the payments export would have stopped at 1,000. All three now read every page, like the "everyone" view already did (`src/lib/db/pages.ts`). A very large payments export writes one audit event per 1,000 rows.

## 5. Monitoring (R7) and owner actions
- **Errors:** unexpected errors in the browser and on the server go to Lovable's error reporting (`src/lib/lovable-error-reporting.ts`, `src/lib/error-capture.ts`, wired in `src/routes/__root.tsx` and `src/server.ts`). Owner: confirm error reporting is on in the Lovable project settings.
- **Failed payments** show as "Failed" on Settings → Payments.
- **Webhook rejections** (a wrong signing secret) aren't stored, because we can't trust the request. They show in the Stripe dashboard under the webhook endpoint's deliveries. Owner: after connecting Stripe, send a test event and check for "Succeeded" (`user-testing.md` §10). An admin-visible "last webhook received" line is a candidate for Wave B.
- **A1, live Stripe test-mode check (owner action):** needs a Stripe test account. On a non-demo test org, connect a test key and webhook, then join, return, refund, and decline with refund, following `user-testing.md` §10.
- **License file (maintainer action):** the repository has no `LICENSE` yet (R-24). Add the official AGPL-3.0 text before the release; it's on the release checklist.
- **R4, receipt wording (owner action):** a CPA should review the wording (R-07). If this isn't done by release, 0.1.0 ships the current placeholder wording and the release notes say so.

## 6. Re-running this review
```bash
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres bun run test:db
```
```bash
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres bun run test:perf
```
```bash
bun audit
```
```bash
bun run test:e2e
```
`test:perf` also prints the catalogue checks from §1.1 and §1.2 (tables without RLS, DELETE policies, definer functions callable without signing in); compare them with the expectations printed alongside.

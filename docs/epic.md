# Epic Map

High-level roadmap. Epics become backlog epics. Stories are written when an epic is pulled into planning. Epic IDs (`E-xx`) are stable. Phases can be reordered when dependencies allow.

## 0. Suite migration: what's left

What's left for the OpenAppHub suite migration to be "done". The same items (S-xx) are tracked in every app's `docs/epic.md`. Status: ✅ done, 🟡 done with follow-ups, 🟠 partly done, ⬜ not started.

| ID | Item | What "done" means | Status (2026-11-11) |
|---|---|---|---|
| S-01 | Production check | After each production deploy, open the app on openapphub.org as a real organization and confirm its data loads (the Charter Members tab was empty until 2026-11-11 because of a renamed key). The staging end-to-end tests catch most of this first. | 🟡 Members fix merged with this round; production not yet checked by a person |
| S-02 | Exposed schemas | `charter`, `board` and `ledger` in Supabase → Data API → Exposed schemas, on staging and production (owner). | ✅ 2026-11-11 |
| S-03 | Integration views for the hub | Read-only `api_*` views (`security_invoker`) and `docs/INTEGRATION.md`, so OpenAppHub's dashboard can show a summary per app (SHARED-SPEC §6). | ⬜ not started (`api_units`, `api_board_seats`, `api_payments_summary`, `api_unit_count`) |
| S-04 | Help links | A per-page help map (`src/config/help.ts`) pointing at the docs site; today the shell has one Help link for the whole app. | ⬜ one app-wide Help link |
| S-05 | Read-only when billing lapses | The database already refuses writes when an organization's trial or plan has lapsed; the screens should show it (billing banner) and switch write controls off. | 🟠 banner shown; write controls not yet switched off |
| S-06 | Export everything | Owners and admins can export all of the app's data (CSV and JSON or the app's own format), also while read-only. | 🟠 members and payments CSV only; no full export yet |
| S-07 | Lovable leftovers | Remove what only Lovable needed: the Vite config wrapper (`@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config`), `previewAuthStorage`, Lovable error reporting, `.lovable/`, the old `supabase/` folder. | ✅ removed |
| S-08 | Worker secrets | Secrets the hosted app needs, on the production Worker and in the Preview base config for staging (owner; never in the repository). | ⬜ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `GATEWAY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` for payments, production and previews |
| S-09 | End-to-end tests | Playwright on a local dev server against staging and the suite demo, in CI on every pull request and daily. | ✅ 2026-11-11 (`live.yml`, 17 tests and the API smoke test) |
| S-10 | Retire the old projects | The Lovable projects and the old Supabase projects, once the app has run on the shared projects for a while (owner). | ⬜ owner; `charter_legacy` dropped only when the owner asks |
| S-11 | One look across the suite | Same shell, menus and settings pattern as the other apps; differences found are listed under Known issues. | ✅ shared AppShell; see Known issues |

Charter-only follow-ups (2026-11-11):

- `charter.purge_smoke_data` still names the retired Demo National ids; it should follow the suite demo or be removed (a migration).
- The end-to-end tests for chapters, regions and two-level dues were retired with Demo National; they need a national demo with chapters (a second demo organization in the suite seed).
- On the Account page the organization switcher reads "No organization": Charter only knows the current organization on an organization's own pages. Board and Ledger show it everywhere.

> **Diagram description:** A left-to-right phase roadmap with nine phases. Phase 0 (Foundation) leads to Phase 1 (Membership MVP), which leads to Phase 2 (Chapters at scale). Phase 2 branches three ways: to Phase 3 (Governance and documents), to Phase 5 (Donations and fundraising), and to Phase 7 (Corporate memberships). Phase 3 leads to Phase 4 (Awards). Phase 5 leads to Phase 6 (Events). Phases 4, 6, and 7 all converge on Phase 8 (Communications and polish). Phases 3, 5, and 7 are therefore independent of each other once Phase 2 is done.

Phases 4 and 5 can swap or run in parallel if two streams are available. Hosted-service billing (E-42) can be pulled earlier if we want to start selling hosting sooner.

Current plans live in [`plans/`](plans/): the review of Phases 1–3 with the plan for what's left ([`phases-1-3-review.md`](plans/phases-1-3-review.md)) and the MVP release plan ([`wave-a-mvp.md`](plans/wave-a-mvp.md)).

## 2. Epics by phase

Status for Phases 0–3 (✅ cleared, 🟡 cleared with follow-ups, 🟠 partly built, ⬜ not started or deferred) comes from the review in [`plans/phases-1-3-review.md`](plans/phases-1-3-review.md), refreshed for the v0.1.0 release candidate (2026-11-05). Phase 1 and Phase 2 exit criteria are met; Phase 0's subdomain sign-in waits for E-07, and Phase 3's are not met yet. Later phases haven't started.

### Phase 0: Foundation

| ID | Epic | Outcome | Status (2026-11-05) |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-01 | Project scaffolding and CI/CD | Repo, lint, types, tests, CI pipeline, environments, npm scripts, local development setup (local Postgres, env vars, `.env.example`) | 🟡 CI, checks, end-to-end tests (including about 40 user-testing steps, D-198, D-202), a performance budget at 5,000–20,000 members (D-209), the pre-commit hook and the docs check run (D-182, D-197); the coverage gate in `instructions.md` §9 needs a dependency decision |
| ~~E-02~~ | ~~Deployment packaging~~ | **Moved to the future backlog as F-11** (D-012). ID retired, not reused | — |
| E-03 | Identity and authentication | Global person and account, sign-in, sessions, email verification, password reset, invitations, **joining a new org with an existing account, org switcher** | ✅ Cleared; account page with a default organization, no separate dashboard (D-192, D-206) |
| E-04 | Organization hierarchy and platform tier | Org tree (platform, national, region, chapter, standalone), org settings, tax profile, **branding with logo upload and chapter override** | ✅ Cleared |
| E-05 | RBAC and permissions | Roles, permissions, scoped assignments with downward inheritance, policy layer | ✅ Cleared |
| E-06 | Audit log | Append-only log and viewer, hooks for all modules | ✅ Cleared |
| E-07 | Host-based tenant resolution | Wildcard subdomain mapping (tested locally with `*.localhost`), org context per request, RLS wiring, tenant-isolation tests. **Deferred** (D-111): RLS and tenant-isolation tests are done; per-org web addresses wait | ⬜ Deferred (D-111); RLS and isolation tests done |
| E-08 | Jobs, email, and notifications infrastructure | Postgres jobs table and scheduled server routes (D-103, replacing pg-boss), email through Lovable's email or the client's own server chosen by `EMAIL_TRANSPORT`, server settings and send-from address per org (D-159), template system, signed-action links that open a signed-in confirmation page (D-164). **Deferred** (D-111); its email follow-up list is in `roadmap.md` | ⬜ Deferred (D-111); first update after the MVP (D-169) |

**Exit:** a national and a chapter can exist, users can sign in on the right subdomain, a chapter admin sees only their chapter, and every action is audited.

### Phase 1: Membership MVP

| ID | Epic | Outcome | Status (2026-11-05) |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-09 | Custom attribute system | Org-defined member attributes (types, validation, visibility), attribute values on members, admin UI | ✅ Cleared |
| E-10 | Setup engine framework + Membership setup flow | Reusable guided-setup framework, first flow covering members, attributes, tiers, and dues questions (see `setup-engine.md`) | ✅ Cleared; setup now also covers prices by member fields (D-177) |
| E-11 | Membership tiers and terms | Org-defined tiers, term options, prices, tax treatment, prepaid model | ✅ Cleared |
| E-12 | Payment gateway abstraction and Stripe | Gateway interface, Stripe adapter, transactions, webhooks, refunds | 🟡 Cleared; transaction export done (D-173); live Stripe test-mode check open (A1, owner action) |
| E-13 | Member signup and renewals | Public join form, application and approval (optional), renewals, lapses, grace periods, standing; national membership with a home chapter (D-166, D-174, D-176) | 🟡 Cleared; automatic lapse notices and reminders wait for E-08 |
| E-14 | Member directory, lists, and exports | Member list with standing and time-to-expiration, filters, saved segments, privacy-aware CSV exports | ✅ Cleared; import, off-roster records and lists past 1,000 rows (D-181, D-189, D-190); checked at 20,000 members (D-209) |
| E-15 | Basic automatic receipts | Receipt on payment, default template, receipt history | ✅ Cleared |

**Exit:** a standalone org can complete setup, sell memberships through Stripe, renew them, see its roster, and export a mailing list.

### Phase 2: Chapters at scale

| ID | Epic | Outcome | Status (2026-11-05) |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-16 | Chapter creation wizard and chapter attributes | National-led chapter creation, national-defined chapter attributes (e.g., charter date), prompts for required officers | ✅ Cleared |
| E-17 | Board role templates and appointments | National-defined seats (required, count, term, permissions), custom titles, appointments with history, access grant and revoke | ✅ Cleared |
| E-18 | Two-level dues and national controls | National and chapter tiers, none/optional-range/required chapter dues, locked or suggested structures (chapter chooses copy or linked, D-165), two-payment checkout UX; alternative model: national membership with a home chapter (D-166) | ✅ Cleared: suggested levels, national standing and the home-chapter model built (D-174, D-177, D-178) |
| E-19 | Rules engine and attribute-based pricing | Declarative rules UI, pricing by attribute (e.g., rank bands), reused later for eligibility and approvals | ✅ Cleared |
| E-20 | Postpaid dues | Balances, invoices, due dates, delinquency, admin-defined enforcement as inheritable settings (D-161), manual payment recording, **parent orgs invoicing subordinate orgs** (national fee, D-162) | ⬜ Not started |
| E-21 | Per-org gateways and PayPal | Each org connects Stripe or PayPal, **Direct mode only** (Connect dropped, D-162), PayPal adapter. The national fee is invoiced through E-20 | 🟠 Partly built (Stripe done; PayPal open) |
| E-22 | Custom domains | Domain settings, DNS verification, on-demand TLS, subdomain remains default. **Needs a reverse proxy, so F-11 must be pulled forward before or with this epic** | ⬜ Not started (keep deferred until F-11) |
| E-23 | National roll-up reporting | Cross-chapter membership and revenue reporting | ✅ Cleared; roll-ups checked at 20,000 members across 80 chapters (D-209) |

**Exit:** national can create a chapter through the wizard, seat its officers, and have it collect its own dues, while national sees roll-ups.

### Phase 3: Governance and documents

| ID | Epic | Outcome | Status (2026-11-05) |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-24 | Approval workflow engine | Generic multi-step approvals, approver resolution, escalation, delegation to national, batch approval, signed one-click links with confirmation page and comment | ⬜ Not started |
| E-25 | Governance compliance | Vacancy alerts, good-standing checks for officers, board reports (types, schedules, submit, review), national oversight dashboard | 🟠 Partly built (good standing, vacancy views) |
| E-26 | Document repository | Libraries, categories, required types, versions, visibility levels, change alerts to national, compliance dashboard | ⬜ Not started |
| E-27 | Elections | Positions, eligibility, nominations, voting windows, single choice and ranked choice, hybrid entry, certification, auto-appointment, immutable results | ⬜ Not started |
| E-28 | Automation engine expansion | Reusable triggers and schedules, the full automation inventory from `architecture.md` | ⬜ Not started (needs E-08) |
| E-43 | Annual chapter reports (optional, per national) | A national that wants annual reports builds the report form itself (its own questions, required or not, using the form builder); sets a due date (and which years); every chapter's president then has a task, "Submit the annual report by …", on their Overview, can save a draft and submit once; the national sees who has submitted, who is late and each answer, and can export them. Entirely optional: a national that doesn't build a form sees nothing. Builds on E-29 (the form builder, pulled forward for this or built first here), E-17 (presidents' seats) and E-08 (reminders, later); review and sign-off can use E-24 | ⬜ Not started (proposed 2026-11-03, D-204) |

**Exit:** national sees vacancies, overdue reports, and document changes at a glance, and a chapter can run an election that seats its new board.

### Phase 4: Awards

| ID | Epic | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| E-29 | Form builder | Org-defined forms with fields, conditional logic, uploads, attribute linkage. Reused by awards first |
| E-30 | Award catalog and approval policies | Awards, families and prerequisites, criteria, per-award forms, tiered approval chains, outcome and appeal settings, payer settings |
| E-31 | Submission, routing, and approvals | Submission flow, routing by chapter/role/rank, rank-verified flag, escalation to national, board-meeting batch approval, email link and portal approvals |
| E-32 | Award purchase and payer | Purchase options, add-ons (e.g., express fee), payer chosen per award or via form, chapter override, receipts, revenue to owning org |
| E-33 | Award fulfillment tracking | National-managed statuses (purchased, in production, shipped, presented), lead times, tracking, presentation date, awards dashboard, member award history |

**Exit:** a member can be nominated, routed to the right approver, approved or escalated, paid for by whoever the award allows, and tracked through shipping.

### Phase 5: Donations and fundraising

| ID | Epic | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| E-34 | Donations | One-time and recurring gifts, designations (restricted/general), donation pages |
| E-35 | Fundraising | Campaigns with goals and progress, peer-to-peer pages, sponsorships |
| E-36 | Receipt templates, manual receipts, year-end statements | Template editor with national inheritance, manual receipts (cash, check, in-kind), void and reissue, year-end summaries |

### Phase 6: Events and registration

| ID | Epic | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| E-37 | Events and registration | Events, ticket types, member vs non-member pricing, registration, check-in, capacity and waitlists, fair-market-value on receipts |

### Phase 7: Corporate memberships

| ID | Epic | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| E-38 | Corporate memberships | Company accounts, seats, company admin, corporate tiers and billing |

### Phase 8: Communications and polish

| ID | Epic | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| E-39 | Communications | Templates, segmented bulk email, scheduled reminders, announcements |
| E-40 | Public sites and widgets | Public chapter pages, listings, embeddable widgets, public awards roll |
| E-41 | Accounting export | Chart-of-accounts mapping per org, generic CSV by date range |
| E-42 | Hosted-service billing and tenant management | Platform admin, usage metering (orgs, chapters, active members), hosting plans and billing, thresholds as configuration |

> **Diagram description:** A top-down dependency map of selected epics. An arrow means "must come before". The connections are:
>
> - E-04 (Org hierarchy) leads to E-05 (RBAC) and E-07 (Tenant resolution).
> - E-05 (RBAC) leads to E-17 (Board seats).
> - E-09 (Attributes) leads to E-10 (Setup engine), E-19 (Rules and pricing), and E-29 (Form builder).
> - E-11 (Tiers) and E-12 (Gateway and Stripe) both lead to E-13 (Signup and renewals).
> - E-13 leads to E-14 (Member lists) and E-18 (Two-level dues); E-19 also leads to E-18.
> - E-17 (Board seats) leads to E-25 (Governance compliance), E-27 (Elections) and E-43 (Annual chapter reports).
> - E-29 (Form builder) also leads to E-43 (Annual chapter reports): the national builds the report form with it.
> - E-08 (Jobs and notifications) and E-19 (Rules) both lead to E-24 (Approval engine).
> - E-24 leads to E-31 (Award approvals) and E-26 (Documents review flow).
> - E-29 (Form builder) leads to E-30 (Award catalog), which leads to E-31.
> - E-31 leads to E-32 (Award purchase), which leads to E-33 (Fulfillment); E-12 also leads to E-32.
> - E-12 leads to E-34 (Donations).
> - E-15 (Receipts) and E-34 both lead to E-36 (Receipt templates).

**Early design dependencies** (items later phases will need, so earlier phases must not close them off):

| Needed later | Must be anticipated in |
|---|---|
| Two-level dues (E-18) | Tier and membership model in E-11 and E-13 (membership belongs to an org, a person can hold several) |
| Rank-based pricing and approver rank (E-19, E-31) | Attribute types in E-09, including ordered lists |
| Setup engine for every module (E-10) | Every later module defines its setup flow as part of its epic |
| Awards as store products (future store) | Purchase options modeled as products in E-32 |
| Approval engine reuse (E-24) | Keep the engine generic, not award-specific |
| Payer flexibility (E-32) | Payment records reference an item and a payer separately from the person it benefits |

## 4. Future backlog (scoped, not scheduled)

| ID | Epic |
|---|---|
| F-01 | Generic store (merchandise, add-ons) on the shared cart and gateway connectors |
| F-02 | Vendor and inventory tracking for physical items and awards |
| F-03 | Delegate-based national elections |
| F-04 | Regional tier features and regional award approvals |
| F-05 | Reply-by-email approvals (inbound parsing) |
| F-06 | Virus scanning for document uploads |
| F-07 | PayPal national-fee mechanism |
| F-08 | Tool-specific accounting export formats |
| F-09 | Internationalization and multi-currency |
| F-10 | Mobile app or PWA enhancements |
| F-11 | **Deployment packaging:** a lightweight standalone install (D-160; default: app + hosted Supabase, D-168): Docker image, Docker Compose (app + hosted Supabase, or app + a minimal self-hosted Supabase subset), Caddy configuration, backup and restore notes, upgrade notes (moved from E-02). Pull forward before E-22 (custom domains) or E-42 (hosted billing), or sooner if we need a shared test environment |

## 5. Scrum guidance

**Cadence (suggestion):** 2-week sprints. Phase 0 is roughly 3 to 4 sprints. Each later phase is roughly 4 to 8 sprints depending on team size. Treat these as placeholders until we have velocity.

**Slicing rules**
- Prefer **vertical slices** (a thin working path through UI, logic, and data) over layer-by-layer work.
- Engines (attributes, rules, setup, approvals, forms) ship with their **first real consumer** in the same phase so they are not built in a vacuum.
- Every module epic includes: its setup-engine flow, audit events, permissions, and automations. These are part of the epic, not separate "later" tickets.

**Definition of Ready (story)**
- Linked to an epic and relevant decision IDs.
- Acceptance criteria written, including permission and tenancy behavior.
- UI/UX notes or a sketch if user-facing.

**Definition of Done (story)**
- Code reviewed, tests passing (unit, integration, and e2e where user-facing).
- **Tenant-isolation test** added or updated for any new tenant-scoped data.
- Permissions enforced through the policy layer.
- Audit events emitted for meaningful actions.
- Migrations reversible or safely forward-only, and seed data updated.
- Docs updated (these planning docs, plus user or admin docs where relevant).
- Configuration comes from environment variables, with no hard dependency on a host-specific feature (keeps later packaging easy).
- Any diagram touched has its **description** updated in the same change.

**Per-epic exit criteria** are listed with each phase above. A phase is done when its exit statement is demonstrably true in a demo.

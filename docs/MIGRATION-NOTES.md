# OpenAppHub suite migration — notes (OpenCharterApp)

Status on 2026-11-10: steps 1–3, 5 and 6 done (§0.4, §9); owner answers in §8, updated for **spec v2** in §8.3. Steps 1–2 are this inventory and the secret scan; step 3 (hygiene) is described in §10. The baseline is written and tested but not yet applied to staging or production. Contract: [`SHARED-SPEC.md`](SHARED-SPEC.md) v2. Decisions: D-217, D-218, D-219.

Goal: the current OpenCharterApp Supabase project (`nxungwtxnctcqolfshcr`) becomes the **production database for the whole suite** (OpenAppHub, OpenCharterApp, OpenBoardApp, OpenLedgerApp). The hub owns sign-up, organizations, members, invitations, ownership and billing (`public`, `billing`, `hub`, `ops`). Charter moves to its own schema `charter`. Self-hosted, Charter still runs on its own.

Sources: `supabase/migrations/` (47 files, `0000`–`0046`; the database is built only from these, D-211/D-212) and `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`. [`migration/phase-0-inventory.md`](migration/phase-0-inventory.md) §6 compared a full replay with `types.ts` object by object and found **nothing created by hand** in `public` except the `branding` bucket (now migration 0046). So no schema dump is needed for this inventory. The owner should still take one before step 4 as a backup (§9).

## 0. Spec v2.2 changes (2026-11-09): read first

Spec v2.2 (`docs/SHARED-SPEC.md`, synced from the hub) changes parts of the plan below. Where this
section and the rest of the file disagree, this section wins.

- **Primary agent.** The OpenAppHub session now drives the suite's PRs, including this repo's. The
  earlier PR #14 was closed (its work is still on that PR's page); its notes are carried over here.
- **Fresh databases.** `openapphub-prod` (`ymlesgadawnjupnvgokd`) and `openapphub-staging`
  (`mbloxixlykmbuuoaprnx`). Nothing is copied or parked; there is no legacy schema. The hub's
  `db/core` is already applied to both (2026-11-09).
- **Step 4 (`0000_park_legacy.sql`) is dropped.** There is no old database to park: the baseline (`0001_charter_baseline.sql`) is Charter's first migration on the new projects.
- Step 3 (hygiene) was done on the closed PR but for spec v2 (`release.yml`, a separate `production` environment). **Redo it against v2.2**: top-level `wrangler.jsonc` = production, `env.staging`, `env.development`; no `release.yml`; old build tooling removed as listed in §7.
- **Deploys.** Cloudflare's Git integration builds `main` and deploys production (`bun run build`, then
  `npx wrangler deploy`). The **top level of `wrangler.jsonc` is production**; `env.staging` and
  `env.development` are the others. No `release.yml`, no `CLOUDFLARE_*` GitHub secrets. Run
  `migrate.yml` against production on a PR's branch **before** merging it; migrations are additive.
- **`VITE_SUITE_URLS` is JSON**: `{"hub":…,"charter":…,"board":…,"ledger":…}`.
- **Design chosen**: "Civic, slightly warm" (`shared/design/DESIGN.md`). Restyling uses the shared
  tokens and `AppShell` (separate PRs, behaviour and visible text unchanged).
- **Cookie consent** is required: render the shared `CookieConsent` once; any new cookie or browser
  storage goes in `COOKIES` (`shared/consent.ts`).
- **Money and dates** only through `shared/format.ts`.
- **PRs and commits**: no "Generated with Claude Code" line, no session link, no
  "Co-Authored-By: Claude" line.

### 0.1 Shared code is vendored (shared 1.1.0)

This PR copies `shared/`, `db/core/`, `scripts/migrate.mjs`, `scripts/check-shared.mjs` and
`docs/SHARED-SPEC.md` from the hub (`scripts/sync-shared.mjs`), sets `"oahShared": "1.1.0"`, and
runs `node scripts/check-shared.mjs` in CI. Nothing imports the shared code yet. Never edit these
files here: change them in Nox-Mob/OpenAppHub and sync.

### 0.2 Next steps

1. ~~Step 3, hygiene (redo for v2.2)~~ **done** (§0.3).
2. ~~Step 5, rest of vendoring~~ and ~~step 6, the baseline~~ **done** (§0.4).
3. ~~Seed, the client switch to schema `charter` (step 9) and org scoping~~ **done** (§0.5).
4. ~~Hosted mode and the AppShell restyle~~ **done** (§0.6).
5. Done 2026-11-11 (§0.7): the suite demo, Worker previews, opening from OpenAppHub, end-to-end tests.
6. **What's left:** [`docs/epic.md`](epic.md) §0 (the suite items S-01 to S-11, the same in every app).

### 0.7 Suite demo, Worker previews, opening from OpenAppHub, end-to-end tests (2026-11-11)

The suite demo has members on varied levels and lengths (`db/seed/0002_charter_demo_levels.sql`); the Members tab works on the `charter` schema (a renamed key had emptied it); `/` has no landing page; Cloudflare previews on `<branch>.charter.staging.openapphub.org` (staging is branch `staging`); the smoke and end-to-end tests run on staging as the suite demo accounts. The remaining migration work is listed in `docs/epic.md`.

### 0.6 Hosted vs self-hosted, suite design (2026-11-10)

- **Hosted** (`VITE_HOSTED=true`):
  - The browser session is a cookie on `.openapphub.org` (`@supabase/ssr`), shared with the hub and the other apps.
  - `/auth` goes to the hub's sign-in and comes back to where the person was going (for example a chapter's join page); signed-out pages do the same.
  - New organizations are created in the hub. The organizations page lists the person's hub organizations that don't use Charter yet, with "Set up as an association" / "Set up as a national with chapters" (`charter.ensure_top_unit`). Chapters are still created in Charter.
  - Account: name, email and password link to the hub's Account page; the default organization stays here.
  - Charter's own invitations (a unit and a Charter role) stay in Charter; they're core invitations with `app = 'charter'`.
  - Signing out returns to the hub. The billing banner shows the top organization's plan.
- **Self-hosted:** unchanged.
- **Restyle** (behaviour and wording unchanged): suite tokens and Inter (the brass rule is now the app accent); every signed-in page is in the shared `AppShell`; an organization's section menu is portalled into its `sidebar` slot (shared 1.3.1), with the suite's nav look; `<html data-app="charter">`, the suite theme script and toggle, cookie consent and a `/cookies` page.

### 0.5 The app on schema `charter`, staging seed, org scoping (2026-11-10)

- **Client:** every Supabase client (browser, request, service role, `src/lib/db/pending-schema.ts`) uses `db: { schema: "charter" }`; core tables with `.schema("public")`. Types are generated from `db/core` + `db/migrations` with `charter` as the default schema.
- **Renames in code:** `organizations` → `units`, `org_member_profiles` → `member_profiles`, column `org_id` → `unit_id` (selects, filters, inserts and row types). Embedded selects keep their property names with aliases (`organizations:units(…)`). The audit label for `units` is "General settings". RPC names and parameters are unchanged. Logos are in bucket `charter-branding`.
- **Invitations:** created and accepted with Charter's wrappers (`charter.create_invitation`, `accept_invitation`, `revoke_invitation`) as before; the list reads core `public.invitations` (`app = 'charter'`, the unit and role in `app_payload`); the invitation page reads core `get_invitation`.
- **Org scoping:** opening a unit sets the suite cookie `oah_org` to its organization (`units.org_id`); after sign-in a person lands on their default organization, else the organization chosen last anywhere in the suite, else their only one.
- **Staging seed:** `db/seed/0001_charter_demo.sql`, ported from `supabase/scripts/demo-test-accounts.sql` and `seed-test-demo.sql`: the three demo accounts, Demo National with Austin and Dallas, and Test-Demo with about 500 people. The password comes from `fixture.demo_password` (`migrate.yml` passes the optional `DEMO_PASSWORD` secret, letters and digits). Refuses production and databases with real organizations; CI loads it after the DB tests.
- **Retired:** `supabase/` (old migrations, scripts, `config.toml`). Self-hosting is `bun run db:migrate` plus exposing `charter` (README).

### 0.3 Step 3 (hygiene) as done for v2.2

- The old Vite wrapper is replaced by a plain `vite.config.ts` with the same plugins; the preview sign-in storage, `cron-auth.ts`, the old error reporting and the old editor's folder are removed. `bun.lock` has none of its packages.
- `.env` is untracked (CI fails on a tracked env file); `.env.example` lists every variable.
- `wrangler.jsonc`: top level = production (`charter.openapphub.org`, `openapphub-prod`), `env.staging` (`staging.charter.staging.openapphub.org`, `openapphub-staging`). `bun run build:hosted` / `build:hosted:staging` load its public `VITE_*` values (`scripts/worker-env.mjs`). No `release.yml` or `staging.yml`.
- Security headers on every page.
- **Self-hosting:** `bun run build` uses your own `.env`; `wrangler.selfhosted.example.jsonc` is the starting point for your own Worker.
- **Owner:** the `opencharterapp` Worker's build command must be `bun run build:hosted` and its deploy command `npx wrangler deploy --config .output/server/wrangler.json`. The hosted app can't work until the baseline (step 6) and client (step 9) are in: the new database has no `charter` schema yet.

### 0.4 Steps 5 and 6: schema `charter` on the core (2026-11-10)

- **`db/migrations/0001_charter_baseline.sql`** builds Charter in schema `charter` on the core (`db/core`), equal to `supabase/migrations` 0000–0046 replayed, with these changes (spec §3.9):
  - Charter's organization tree is **`charter.units`**; the top unit has the **same id as the core organization** (the customer). Every former `org_id` (a unit) is now **`unit_id`**, including RPC parameters (`_org_id` → `_unit_id`) and audit `target_type` (`'units'`). `org_member_profiles` is `charter.member_profiles`.
  - Every table has a new **`org_id`** (the core organization), set by trigger from the unit, with a foreign key to `public.organizations` (`on delete cascade`, so deleting the organization in the hub removes Charter's data) and an index.
  - Creating a top unit without a core organization (self-hosted) creates one, with the creator as owner. `charter.ensure_top_unit(org)` opens an organization made in the hub in Charter (owner or admin only).
  - **Permissions:** a core owner or admin holds `org_admin`'s permissions in the whole tree. Staff roles need a core role of member or higher (a core viewer keeps only member access); assigning a staff role adds a core `member` membership (trigger). Dues members need no core membership (`charter.is_portal_member`).
  - **Read-only when the plan lapses** (spec §6.3): every write checks `public.can_write(org, 'charter')`; payment paths (gateway completion, failure, refund, webhook claim, receipts) set `charter.payment_recording` and still record.
  - **Invitations** are core `public.invitations` with `app = 'charter'` and the unit and role in `app_payload`; `charter.create_invitation`, `accept_invitation`, `revoke_invitation` wrap them and `charter.on_invitation_accepted` gives the role.
  - `private` tables (gateway secrets, platform flags, platform operators) are in `charter`, with no client grants. Platform operators and demo organizations stay for self-hosters until step 11.
  - Anonymous access (the public join page) is granted only when billing is off (self-hosted).
  - Row rules check permissions set-based (`unit_id in (select charter.permitted_units(...))`), so they stay fast at scale.
- **Runner and CI:** `scripts/migrate.mjs` records under `opencharterapp`. CI's database job and the performance job apply the core and the baseline with the runner, then run `db/tests` (36 files, all passing, plus `9V_openapphub_core` for the points above) and the 5,000–20,000 member timings. At 20,000 members, locally: overview 289 ms, members roll-up 247 ms, everyone view 81 ms, payments export 388 ms (the old schema: 281, 254, 399, 244).
- **`migrate.yml`** (owner, by hand): staging gets `--seed`; production is run on a PR's branch before merging.
- **Retired:** `supabase-db.yml` (replay and deploy), `supabase/ci`, `drizzle/`, `drizzle.config.ts` and the drizzle packages. `check:migrations` now checks `db/migrations`.
- **Kept, frozen:** `supabase/migrations`, `supabase/config.toml` and `supabase/scripts`, for self-hosters until the client switch (step 9; `supabase/README.md`).

## 1. Database objects in the current project

### 1.1 Schemas

| Schema | Created by | Contents | Exposed to Data API |
|---|---|---|---|
| `public` | Supabase, used by every Charter migration | 31 tables, 147 functions, 17 enums | yes |
| `private` | `0009` (`create schema if not exists private`) | 3 tables (gateway secrets, platform flags, platform operators) | no |
| `auth`, `storage`, `extensions`, `supabase_migrations` | Supabase | not Charter's; only `storage.objects` policies and a `storage.buckets` row are Charter's | — |

No extensions are created. `pgcrypto` (`extensions.digest`, `gen_random_bytes`) is used.

### 1.2 Tables (34)

Every `public` table has `org_id` (except the global catalogue tables noted), RLS, explicit grants and at least one policy (checked by `bun run check:migrations` and `supabase/ci/post-replay-check.sql`). Links and write paths: [`tables.md`](tables.md).

| Table | Org-scoped | Maps to core? | Area |
|---|---|---|---|
| `public.organizations` | is the org | **Core** `public.organizations` (id, name, slug, created_by, created_at). Charter-only columns: `parent_id`, `type` (`org_type`), `ancestor_ids`, `timezone`, `status`, `updated_at` | orgs |
| `public.org_member_profiles` | yes | **Partly core.** Rows with `user_id` are people who sign in, the core `memberships` row of that user. Rows without `user_id` are roster records (no login). Also holds `display_name`, `email`, `directory_listed`, `home_of`, `left_at`, so it stays Charter's (`charter.member_profiles`) | members |
| `public.roles`, `public.role_permissions`, `public.permissions`, `public.role_assignments` | `roles`/`role_assignments` yes; `permissions` global; `roles.org_id null` = built-in | **Partly core.** `org_admin` maps to core `owner`/`admin`. The fine-grained, per-org custom roles and downward inheritance (D-032) are Charter-specific | roles |
| `public.invitations` | yes | **Core, run by the hub** in hosted mode (§1.1 of the spec: invites happen in the hub). Charter keeps its own flow for self-hosted | access |
| `public.memberships` | yes | **No — name clash only.** Charter's `memberships` are *dues memberships* (level, term, paid through), not core org memberships. Becomes `charter.memberships` | dues |
| `public.membership_tiers`, `tier_terms`, `membership_events`, `pricing_rules` | yes | Charter | dues |
| `public.payments`, `gateway_connections`, `webhook_events`, `receipts`, `receipt_counters`, `tax_profiles` | yes (`webhook_events` by gateway) | Charter. **Not suite billing:** these are the org's own Stripe account collecting member dues. The hub's billing (§5) is the org paying for the app | money |
| `public.seat_templates`, `seat_terms`, `seat_title_overrides`, `seat_contacts`, `appointments` | yes | Charter (board seats and officers) | governance |
| `public.attribute_definitions`, `attribute_options`, `attribute_values`, `member_segments` | yes | Charter | member fields |
| `public.org_settings`, `setup_states` | yes | Charter (settings engine, setup flows) | settings |
| `public.affiliation_history`, `audit_events` | yes | Charter (append-only) | history |
| `private.gateway_secrets` | yes | Charter (encrypted Stripe keys per org) | money |
| `private.platform_flags`, `private.platform_operators` | no | **Moves to the hub** (Q6). Platform operators can create demo orgs (`is_platform_operator`) | platform |

### 1.3 Views

None.

### 1.4 Enums (17, all in `public`)

`attribute_subject`, `attribute_type`, `attribute_visibility`, `gateway_status`, `membership_event_kind`, `membership_status`, `org_type` (`platform`, `national`, `region`, `chapter`, `standalone`), `payment_gateway`, `payment_method`, `payment_purpose`, `payment_status`, `receipt_status`, `seat_scope`, `setting_mode`, `setup_status`, `tax_treatment`, `term_unit`.

None clash with core's `public.org_role`.

### 1.5 Functions (147 in `public`, none in `private`; 134 `security definer`)

**Clash with core names** (core defines them in `db/core/0002`, so Charter's must leave `public` first):
`create_organization` (Charter: `(_name, _slug, _type, _parent)`, enforces the hierarchy and seeds `org_admin`; core: `(p_name)`).

Same idea as a core helper but a different name and signature: `is_org_member(_user, _org)` ≈ core `is_member(p_org)`; `has_permission(_user, _perm, _org)` ≈ core `has_role` (but permission-based and inherited downwards).

**Permission and visibility helpers:** `has_permission`, `is_org_member`, `can_see_org_tree`, `can_read_attribute_value`, `holds_all_role_permissions`, `is_platform_operator`, `privacy_admin_override_allowed`, `emails_allowed`, `test_gateway_allowed`, `role_applies_at`, `seat_applies_at`, `resolve_role`.

**Trigger functions (21):** `affiliation_history_append_only`, `appointments_guard`, `attribute_definition_subject_check`, `attribute_option_org_check`, `audit_row_change`, `chapter_dues_range_check`, `enforce_setting_lock`, `gateway_connection_check`, `level_link_guard`, `membership_events_append_only`, `membership_model_guard`, `org_demo_guard`, `payments_receipts`, `receipts_guard`, `seat_terms_append_only`, `set_org_ancestors`, `sync_linked_levels_trigger`, `tier_identity_guard`, `tier_parent_check`, `tier_term_org_check`, plus `write_audit` (called by them).

**RPCs the app calls (75):** `accept_invitation`, `admin_create_member`, `adopt_suggested_level`, `apply_setup`, `appoint_officer`, `assign_role`, `audit_log`, `begin_join`, `begin_renewal`, `board_history`, `chapter_national_standing`, `complete_gateway_payment`, `complete_test_payment`, `connect_test_gateway`, `create_demo_organization`, `create_invitation`, `create_organization`, `create_role`, `decline_application`, `define_seat`, `delete_demo_organization`, `disconnect_gateway`, `end_appointment`, `export_payments`, `fail_gateway_payment`, `gateway_sealed_credentials`, `get_invitation`, `grace_days`, `import_members`, `is_platform_operator`, `join_requirements`, `lineage_settings`, `log_member_export`, `log_report_export`, `make_level_own`, `mark_payment_refunded`, `member_directory`, `membership_model`, `org_board`, `org_board_contacts`, `org_lineage`, `org_overview_stats`, `org_rollup_governance`, `org_rollup_members`, `org_rollup_revenue`, `public_home_chapter_info`, `public_join_info`, `quote_price`, `recalculate_planned_ends`, `record_membership`, `reissue_receipt`, `remove_member_record`, `remove_role`, `restore_member_record`, `revoke_invitation`, `save_pricing_rule`, `save_stripe_connection`, `set_attribute_value`, `set_checkout_ref`, `set_home_chapter`, `set_linked_level_price`, `set_member_home_chapter`, `set_my_directory_listing`, `set_pricing_rule_active`, `set_role_active`, `set_seat_active`, `set_seat_contact`, `set_seat_scope`, `set_seat_term`, `set_seat_title`, `sync_my_email`, `update_member_record`, `update_role`, `update_seat`, `void_receipt`.

**Internal helpers (the rest):** `ancestor_setting`, `apply_setup_sections`, `approve_membership`, `cancel_membership`, `check_role_permissions`, `claim_webhook_event`, `decline_membership`, `effective_approval_required`, `effective_setting`, `grant_membership_term`, `issue_receipt`, `issue_receipt_internal`, `linked_price`, `listed_in_directory`, `membership_standing`, `move_home_chapter`, `national_dues_required`, `national_membership_state`, `national_org`, `org_subtree`, `payment_failed`, `payment_refunded`, `payment_succeeded`, `pricing_condition_matches`, `profile_membership_id`, `profile_values`, `purge_smoke_data`, `receipt_logo`, `receipt_snapshot`, `receipt_tax_wording`, `renewal_start`, `seat_planned_end`, `seat_template_check`, `seat_term_in_force`, `sync_linked_level`, `term_end`, `term_price`, `validate_attribute_value`, `validate_join_answers`, `validate_pricing_conditions`.

**Granted to `anon`** (needs owner approval under spec §3.4): `public_join_info(text)` and `public_home_chapter_info(text)`, behind the public join page `/join/$orgSlug`.

### 1.6 Triggers (47, all on Charter tables)

- `audit_<table>` → `audit_row_change` on 25 tables: `affiliation_history`, `appointments`, `attribute_definitions`, `attribute_options`, `attribute_values`, `gateway_connections`, `invitations`, `member_segments`, `membership_tiers`, `memberships`, `org_member_profiles` (`audit_profiles`), `org_settings`, `organizations`, `payments`, `pricing_rules`, `receipts`, `role_assignments`, `roles`, `seat_contacts`, `seat_templates`, `seat_terms`, `seat_title_overrides`, `setup_states`, `tax_profiles`, `tier_terms`.
- Guards: `affiliation_history_append_only`, `membership_events_append_only`, `seat_terms_append_only`, `appointments_guard`, `receipts_guard`, `organizations_demo_guard`, `gateway_connections_check`, `attribute_definitions_subject`, `attribute_options_org`.
- Settings: `org_settings_lock` (`enforce_setting_lock`), `membership_model_guard`.
- Hierarchy: `organizations_ancestors` (`set_org_ancestors`).
- Levels: `membership_tiers_identity`, `_link_guard`, `_parent`, `_sync_linked`; `tier_terms_identity`, `_link_guard`, `_org`, `_dues_range`, `_sync_linked`.
- Money: `payments_receipts`.

### 1.7 Triggers on `auth.users`

**None.** No migration creates a trigger on any `auth` table (`grep` of every migration; also phase-0-inventory §2). Charter has no `handle_new_user`; it reads `auth.users.email` inside definer functions and `sync_my_email`. So core's `on_auth_user_created` won't replace anything of Charter's. Step 4 still guards a `drop trigger if exists` in case one was made by hand.

### 1.8 Storage

| Bucket | Public? | Path | Policies on `storage.objects` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `branding` (2 MB; PNG/JPEG/SVG/WebP) | private, signed URLs | `<org_id>/…` (already the spec's layout) | `branding public read` (narrowed by 0042 to `can_see_org_tree`), `branding managers insert` / `update` / `delete` (`has_permission(…, 'org.manage', …)`) |

The policies call `public.can_see_org_tree` and `public.has_permission`. Postgres stores the function OID, so after step 4 they keep pointing at the parked copies in `charter_legacy`. Step 6 replaces them with policies using `public.is_member` / `public.can_write`.

### 1.9 Edge Functions

**None** (no `supabase/functions/`). Server-side code runs as TanStack Start server functions on the Cloudflare Worker:

- `src/modules/payments/payments.server.ts` and `payments.functions.ts`: the Stripe dues checkout, using `supabaseAdmin` (service role, `src/integrations/supabase/client.server.ts`).
- `src/routes/api/public/stripe.$orgId.ts`: the per-org Stripe webhook for dues.
- `src/integrations/supabase/cron-auth.ts`: cron secret check (no route uses it yet).

## 2. Concept map: core vs Charter

| Concept | Today (Charter) | Suite (core) | Plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| Organization | `public.organizations`, a **tree**: platform → national → region → chapter, or standalone | flat `public.organizations`, one row per paying customer | **Decided (Q2):** the top of the tree is the core org; chapters and regions become `charter.units` under it |
| Who can use an org | `org_member_profiles` row with a `user_id`, `left_at is null` (`is_org_member`) | `public.memberships` (owner/admin/member/viewer) | `charter.member_profiles.user_id` must have a core membership to read; RLS read rule becomes `public.is_member(org_id)` |
| Roles and permissions | custom roles per org, permission keys (`org.manage`, `members.manage`, …), inherited downwards (D-032) | 4 fixed roles | Keep Charter's permissions *inside* the core gate: a write needs `public.can_write(org_id,'charter')` **and** the Charter permission. Core `owner`/`admin` ⇒ Charter `org_admin` |
| Profile | `org_member_profiles.display_name` / `email` per org | `public.profiles`, `public.org_member_directory` | Signed-in people's names from the core directory; roster-only records keep their own fields (v2) |
| Invitations | `create_invitation` / `accept_invitation` RPCs, token hashes | core `public.invitations` and functions; hub screens when hosted (v2 §4.3) | Charter's RPCs not recreated; `/invite/<token>` page on `shared/ui/InvitationPage` plus `charter.on_invitation_accepted` |
| Creating an org | `create_organization(_name,_slug,_type,_parent)` | `public.create_organization(p_name)` | top-level orgs through core (hub when hosted); units through `charter.create_unit(…)` |
| Ownership | `org_admin` role holders | exactly one core `owner`; `public.transfer_ownership` (v2 §4.4) | hosted: link to the hub; self-hosted: Charter screen calling the core function |
| App billing | none | `billing.*`, `get_org_billing`, `can_write` | new: banner and read-only mode (step 12) |
| Member dues | `payments`, `gateway_connections`, Stripe per org | — | stays Charter's, `charter` schema |
| Platform operators | `private.platform_operators` | not in the spec | **moves to the hub** (Q6); not recreated in `charter` |
| Audit log | `audit_events` via triggers | — | stays Charter's |

## 3. Every place the code calls Supabase

64 files outside tests. Clients: `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` (browser and SSR, `createClient`, preview sign-in storage), `client.server.ts` (service role, server only), `auth-attacher.ts` / `auth-middleware.ts` (bearer token from the browser to server functions, `getClaims`). In step 9 all of them move to the shared client; every `.from()` below gets the `charter` schema by default (`VITE_APP_SCHEMA=charter`), and core tables need `.schema('public')`.

| File | Tables (`.from`) | RPCs (`.rpc`) | Auth / storage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `src/components/app-shell.tsx` | | | `signOut` |
| `src/components/attributes/attributes-tab.tsx` | attribute_definitions, attribute_options | | |
| `src/components/create-org-dialog.tsx` | | create_organization | |
| `src/components/membership/join-form.tsx` | | | `getSession` |
| `src/components/membership/membership-rules-card.tsx` | | lineage_settings | |
| `src/components/org/member-details-dialog.tsx` | | create_invitation | |
| `src/components/org/members-tab.tsx` | invitations, role_assignments | assign_role, create_invitation, remove_role, revoke_invitation | `getUser` |
| `src/components/org/roles-tab.tsx` | | create_role, set_role_active, update_role | |
| `src/components/org/settings-tab.tsx` | org_settings, organizations, tax_profiles | lineage_settings, org_lineage | |
| `src/lib/orgs.ts` | **organizations, role_assignments** (the org list; becomes core memberships + `shared/supabase/org.ts`) | | `getUser` |
| `src/modules/account/index.ts` | org_member_profiles | sync_my_email | `updateUser` |
| `src/modules/account/landing.ts` | | | `updateUser` |
| `src/modules/attributes/queries.ts` | attribute_definitions, attribute_values | | |

## 4. Secret scan (step 2, spec §7)

Scanned the working tree and **all 186 commits on every branch** (`git grep` over `git rev-list --all`) for `sb_secret_`, `sk_live_`, `sk_test_`, `rk_live_`/`rk_test_`, `whsec_`, JWTs (`eyJ…` legacy anon/service-role keys), Postgres URLs with a password, private keys, AWS/GitHub/Slack/Google keys, and `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` / `DB_PASSWORD` / `GATEWAY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / `CRON_SECRET` / `SMOKE_DEMO_PASSWORD` with a value. History was not rewritten.

| Finding | Where | Risk | Owner action |
|---|---|---|---|
| No service-role key, `sb_secret_`, live or real test Stripe key, webhook secret or DB password, now or in history | — | — | none |
| Fake Stripe keys in unit tests (`rk_test_1234567890abc…`, `sk_test_1234567890abc`, `whsec_1234567890abcdef`) | `src/modules/payments/stripe.test.ts`, `src/components/payments/payments-tab.test.tsx` | none (made-up placeholders) | none; GitHub push protection may flag them, mark as false positive |
| Publishable key and URL of the production project | `.env` (committed), `wrangler.jsonc` `vars` | none: publishable values are public by design | none. Hygiene step 3 still stops committing `.env` (spec §7: `.env*` other than `.env.example` must be ignored) |
| Older `.env` versions in history | commits `7253751`, `629b413` | only publishable values (old project `odqswxftrhtvyadizkgn`) | none |
| **Shared demo password in plain text** (removed from the docs and the smoke-test fallback in this PR; still in history) | `docs/demo-data.md:7` (and history) | **Medium.** The demo accounts (`@opencharter.test`) live on the project that becomes the suite's production database. With one login for the suite, anyone who reads the public repo can sign in to the hub and every app as a demo admin or platform operator | **Owner decided (Q8): delete the demo accounts** on production (§8.2) |

Also recommended (owner settings): enable GitHub secret scanning and push protection on all five repos.

---

## 5. Where this repo differs from what the spec assumed (all settled by spec v2)

| # | Difference | Settled |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | TanStack Start with SSR on a **Cloudflare Worker**, not a Vite SPA on Pages | v2 §2, §10: every app runs on Workers. Headers come from the server entry; no `_redirects`/`_headers` (done in step 3, §10) |
| 2 | Org tree vs flat orgs | v2 §3.9: top of the tree = core org; `charter.units` (D-218) |
| 3 | Dues-paying members who sign in | v2 §4.5: portal access in Charter, not core memberships; they sign up at the hub |
| 4 | `anon` RPCs for the public join page | v2 §3.4, §4.5: approved **self-hosted only**, created when `billing_enabled` is false |
| 5 | Charter's own Stripe for dues | v2 §6.3: stays in Charter |
| 6 | Read-only while a plan has lapsed | v2 §6.3: payments, refunds and receipts keep being recorded; new joins and renewals are refused |
| 7 | Old migration tooling (`supabase/migrations`, `supabase db push`, `check:migrations`) | v2 §3.3: switched off in the step that adds the runner (step 5) |
| 8 | Phase 1 cutover not finished; downtime from step 4 | accepted (Q7). The hosted site is down between park and baseline (START-HERE) |
| 9 | Two sources for a person's name | v2 §3.2: signed-in people's names come from `public.profiles` via `org_member_directory`; roster-only records keep their own |
| 10 | D-215 (no session links or "Generated with Claude Code" lines) | still applies (AGENTS v2) |

## 6. Dependencies outside this repo

- **`Nox-Mob/OpenAppHub` doesn't exist yet** (checked 2026-11-08). It holds the canonical `shared/`, `db/core/` and `scripts/migrate.mjs`. Steps 5, 6 and 8–15 here need them. START-HERE v2: create it first; everything else is blocked on its Phase 1–2.
- ~~Disconnect the old editor from this repo~~ (done).
- `Nox-Mob/OpenAppHub-docs` exists (Phase 5 docs PRs).
- `Nox-Mob/openboardapp` and `Nox-Mob/OpenLedgerApp` follow Charter; Board's old project becomes staging only after Board is migrated.

## 7. Repo rules the spec replaces, and when

Until a step replaces a rule, the old rule stands.

| Repo rule (`AGENTS.md`) | Suite rule (spec v2) | Replaced in |
|---|---|---|
| Old editor note at the top of `AGENTS.md`; its toolchain and config wrapper | old build tooling removed (§2) | **step 3 (done)** |
| Committed `.env`; Worker built from `main` by Cloudflare's Git integration | `.env` untracked; `wrangler.jsonc` envs; `staging.yml` on `main`, owner-run `release.yml` (§7.1, §10.2) | **step 3 (done)**; owner switches off the Git build |
| Migrations in `supabase/migrations`, deployed by the "Supabase database" workflow; `check:migrations` on the old import rules | `db/migrations` + vendored runner; old `deploy` job off; lint pointed at `db/` (§3.3) | step 5 |
| Tenant tables in `public`, RLS with `has_permission` / `is_org_member` | `charter` schema; reads `public.is_member` (or portal access), writes through Charter helpers that always include `public.can_write(org_id,'charter')` (§3.4, §3.5) | step 6 |
| Orgs only via Charter's `create_organization` | top-level orgs via `public.create_organization` (hub when hosted); units via `charter.create_unit` | step 6 |
| Invitations via Charter's `create_invitation` / `accept_invitation` | core invitations (§4.3); Charter keeps an `/invite/<token>` page and `charter.on_invitation_accepted` | steps 6, 11 |
| Logos in the private `branding` bucket | `charter-branding` (§3.7) | step 6 |
| Demo orgs and platform operators in Charter | hub (§11) | step 6 (not recreated), step 11 (screens out of routing) |
| No `DROP TABLE`/`DROP COLUMN` in migrations | same idea: park first, drop `charter_legacy` only when the owner asks | unchanged |
| Pending-schema shims (D-135) | types from `gen-types.yml` (§3.8) | step 9 |
| e2e and smoke tests against the live demo on production | demo on staging only (§11) | step 7 (seed), then `live.yml` points at staging |

## 8. Owner decisions (2026-11-08, D-218)

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Spec §0 inputs | **Open.** Prices aren't decided: the owner is weighing one price for a single org against a price for an org with many sub-orgs. Domain, design reference and outlier apps, and staging ref still to come. Production ref: the current Charter project, `nxungwtxnctcqolfshcr` |
| Q2 | What is a core organization? | **The top of the tree** (a national, or a standalone org) is the one `public.organizations` row: the billed organization and billing customer, and the shared org ID for Board and Ledger. Its regions and chapters are **included under its licence** and live in Charter as `charter.units` (parent, type, ancestors, timezone). Every Charter table gets `org_id → public.organizations` (the customer), plus `unit_id → charter.units` where today's `org_id` points at a chapter or region. Core RLS (`is_member`, `can_write`) guards the customer; Charter's permissions guard units inside it. No change to core or billing |
| Q3 | Who counts as a billed member? | **Only admins, officers and staff.** They get a core `public.memberships` row and count toward the plan's member limit (the hub's `max_members` trigger, unchanged). Ordinary dues-paying members get Charter-only access (`charter.member_profiles.user_id`, checked by a Charter function such as `charter.is_portal_member`), so they can see the directory and pay dues without counting. Charter's read policies become `public.is_member(org_id) or charter.is_portal_member(org_id, unit_id)` where members may read |
| Q4 | Join page and sign-up in hosted mode | **Charter's join page (`/join/$orgSlug`) is for self-hosting only**; it is left out of routing in hosted mode. Joining members **sign up with OpenAppHub.** The two `anon` RPCs (`public_join_info`, `public_home_chapter_info`) are therefore only needed self-hosted |
| Q5 | Seed data | **Deferred.** The owner provides seed data later, once all three apps are under OpenAppHub. It should match what a user sees when starting fresh. Step 7 waits; nothing is copied from `charter_legacy` |
| Q6 | Platform operators and demo accounts | **Move to the hub.** Charter's `private.platform_operators`, `platform_flags` and the demo-org RPCs (`create_demo_organization`, `delete_demo_organization`, `is_platform_operator`) are not recreated in `charter`; the hub owns the concept. Charter's "Create demo" screens are left out of routing until the hub offers it |
| Q7 | Downtime | **Fine.** There are no production accounts besides demos, so the hosted site can be down between step 4 and step 9. No maintenance page |
| Q8 | Demo password | **Remove the demo accounts for now.** The password is taken out of the repo's docs and the smoke-test fallback (this PR); the owner deletes the accounts on production (§8.2) |

### 8.1 Follow-up questions these answers raise

- **F1 (from Q2/Q3, for pricing) — covered by v2 (`charter.api_unit_count`, `billing.plans.max_units`).** with the top of the tree as the customer and only staff counting, a plan's natural dimensions are *billed members* (staff seats, already in the spec) and *number of units* (chapters/regions under the licence). Charter can report both: the unit count from `charter.units`, the staff count from core `memberships`. If the price should depend on the unit count, the hub's billing needs to read it, through a `charter.api_unit_count` view (step 14). Decide when prices are set; nothing in steps 3–11 depends on it.
- **F2 (from Q4) — settled by v2: option (a).** after a member signs up at the hub, **how do they join a chapter and pay its dues?** Options: (a) the hub's sign-up returns them to a signed-in **Join** screen in Charter (`charter.<apex>/join/<slug>`, no sign-up form, the dues checkout stays in Charter); (b) the hub hosts the whole join flow and calls a Charter RPC (`charter.begin_join`, `security invoker`, spec §3.5). Recommended: (a), since dues payments go to the org's own Stripe account, which only Charter knows. Needed by step 11.
- **F3 (from Q3) — settled by v2 as proposed.** which Charter roles count as "staff"? Proposed: anyone holding a role with any permission beyond the built-in **Member** role (for example `org_admin`, officer roles from board seats, custom roles with `members.manage`) gets a core membership; core `owner`/`admin` for `org_admin` at the top of the tree, core `member` for the rest. Needed by step 6.

### 8.2 Owner actions from these answers

1. **Delete the demo accounts on production now:** Supabase → Authentication → Users → delete `demo-national@opencharter.test`, `demo-chapter@opencharter.test`, `demo-member@opencharter.test` (and any other `@opencharter.test` account). Their orgs and records stay until step 4 parks them. Then delete the `SMOKE_DEMO_PASSWORD` repository secret: the live checks now skip without it instead of failing.
2. Rotate nothing else: the scan found no other secret.

### 8.3 Spec v2 answers (2026-11-08, D-219)

| Item | Answer |
|---|---|
| Q1 inputs | Spec §0.1 filled in: apex `openapphub.org`; production `nxungwtxnctcqolfshcr`; staging `dnsqxiiexkdokgebysrt` (today's OpenBoardApp project, reused after Board moves); docs `docs.openapphub.org`. **Design: a full refresh** for every app; Charter isn't a reference app. **Prices not confirmed.** |
| Hosting | **Workers**, headers in the Worker (done in step 3) |
| Q2, Q3, F3 | As proposed: `charter.units`; staff (anyone with a role beyond the built-in Member) get core memberships; `org_admin` at the top unit → core `owner`/`admin`, others core `member`; portal members don't count |
| Q4, F2 | Option (a): hosted `/join/<slug>` is a **signed-in** join screen in Charter; signed-out visitors go to the hub's sign-up (`loginRedirect` with `next`) and come back. Public join page with Charter's own sign-up: self-hosted only |
| Q5 | Seed deferred, but **demo runs on staging**: a minimal `db/seed/0001_charter_demo.sql` is wanted now (refuses to run when real orgs exist; addresses on `@demo.openapphub.org`; no passwords in the repo) |
| Q6 | Platform operators and demo orgs move to the hub; not recreated |
| Q7, Q8 | As decided |
| Dues | Stay in Charter. While read-only: record payments, refunds and receipts; refuse new joins and renewals |
| Invitations | Core, handled by the hub. Charter's invitation RPCs aren't recreated; Charter keeps `/invite/<token>` on `shared/ui/InvitationPage` and adds `charter.on_invitation_accepted(p_invitation_id)` (link the roster record from `app_payload`, grant portal access, assign a Charter role) |
| Ownership | Core; transferred in the hub (hosted). Self-hosted: Charter's screen calls `public.transfer_ownership` |
| Service role | Charter may use it only for dues payment completion, failure and refund recording (`payments.server.ts`, the dues webhook route; §7.2). That matches today's only use |

F1 (pricing by unit count) is covered: Charter publishes `charter.api_unit_count` (step 14), and `billing.plans.max_units` is reserved.

## 9. Plan: the remaining steps

One branch and one PR per step. **Bold** = changes production's database; the owner applies it with `release.yml` or `migrate.yml` (`target: production`). Agents never do.

| # | Step | Status / needs first | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1–2 | Inventory + secret scan | **done** | this file; the spec; the suite section of `AGENTS.md` |
| 3 | Hygiene | **done** (§10) | `.env` untracked, `.env.example` with every variable, `wrangler.jsonc` staging/production, `staging.yml` + `release.yml`, security headers in the Worker, old build tooling removed |
| 4 | **`db/migrations/0000_park_legacy.sql`** | next; owner backup first; demo accounts deleted; old editor disconnected | `create schema if not exists charter_legacy`; every Charter table (31 in `public`, 3 in `private`), enum (17) and function (147) moved with `alter … set schema charter_legacy`, each guarded by a catalog check so a re-run skips it; API grants revoked on `charter_legacy`; `drop trigger if exists on_auth_user_created on auth.users` (none today). The `branding` bucket and its policies stay (they follow the parked functions). Nothing dropped. PR line 1: "Runs on PRODUCTION project; owner must apply before the hub's core migrations." Tested by replaying `supabase/migrations` locally, applying it twice and checking `public` holds no Charter objects |
| — | (Hub) `db/core/*` + `0001_billing.sql` on production | step 4 applied | in OpenAppHub |
| 5 | Vendor shared code | OpenAppHub `shared/` | copy `shared/`, `db/core/`, `scripts/migrate.mjs`; `migrate.yml`; the `db` CI job; `"oahShared"` in `package.json`; **switch off the `deploy` job in `supabase-db.yml`**; point `check:migrations` at `db/` (§3.3). `staging.yml` and `release.yml` pick up the runner automatically |
| 6 | **`db/migrations/0001_charter_baseline.sql`** | step 5 | `charter` schema per §3.4: `charter.units` (§3.9); every table with `org_id` (billed org) and `unit_id`; `charter.member_profiles`; write helpers always `public.can_write(org_id,'charter')` then the Charter permission; `charter.is_portal_member(p_org, p_unit)` for dues members' reads; `charter.create_unit`; `charter.on_invitation_accepted`; no Charter invitation tables, no platform-operator or demo-org objects; `public_join_info` / `public_home_chapter_info` created and granted to `anon` only when `billing_enabled` is false; `begin_join` / `begin_renewal` refuse when `public.has_app_access(org,'charter')` is false, payment recording doesn't check it; `charter.org_settings`; bucket **`charter-branding`** with `public.is_member` read and the write helper for writes on `<org_id>/`; `supabase/migrations/` deleted in the same PR |
| 7 | `db/seed/0001_charter_demo.sql` | step 6 | minimal, idempotent demo for **staging**; refuses to run if real orgs exist; `@demo.openapphub.org` addresses; no passwords in the repo. The owner's full content comes later (Q5) |
| 8 | DB tests | step 6 | port `db/tests/*.sql` to `charter`; for every table: org isolation, viewer can't write, read-only when the trial expired; overlay rules (§3.5); portal members; read-only dues rules (§6.3) |
| 9 | Supabase client | steps 5–6 | `shared/supabase/client.ts` (`VITE_APP_SCHEMA=charter`), `.schema('public')` for core; server client and auth middleware on the same schema; `gen-types.yml`; drop `pending-schema` shims |
| 10 | Org scoping | step 9 | `src/lib/orgs.ts` → `shared/supabase/org.ts` (`oah_org`); every query carries the current org and unit |
| 11 | Hosted vs self-hosted | step 10 | `VITE_HOSTED`: `/` → app; sign-in and sign-up → hub; hosted `/join/<slug>` requires sign-in (`loginRedirect` to the hub's sign-up with `next`); invitations, org creation, ownership and core roles link to the hub; `/invite/<token>` on `shared/ui/InvitationPage`; demo-org screens out of routing; Charter's own roles, permissions, seats and roster stay in Charter |
| 12 | Billing state | step 11; hub's `get_org_billing` | `BillingBanner`; write controls off when read-only; link to `${VITE_HUB_URL}/billing` |
| 13 | Export | step 9 | owners/admins export all Charter data (JSON and CSV), also when read-only |
| 14 | Integration surface | step 6 | `charter.api_units`, `charter.api_board_seats`, `charter.api_payments_summary`, `charter.api_unit_count`, `security_invoker = true`; `docs/INTEGRATION.md` |
| 15 | Design | hub's design direction approved | adopt the new shared design (not a token swap): separate PRs, before/after screenshots, behaviour and visible text unchanged unless the owner approves |
| 16–17 | Help links and docs | docs repo | `src/config/help.ts` (AGENTS v2 table); the `charter/` docs pages listed in AGENTS v2 |
| later | drop `charter_legacy` | owner says everything works | separate migration, only when asked |

Order on production (START-HERE): Charter 0000 → Hub core + billing → Charter 0001 → Board 0001 → Ledger 0001 → wipe Board's old project, which becomes staging.

## 10. Step 3 (hygiene): what changed, and the owner's steps

**Changed (D-219):**
- **Environment files:** `.env` is no longer tracked; `.gitignore` ignores every `.env*` except `.env.example`; `.env.example` lists every variable (Supabase, suite settings, server values, secrets, local testing). CI fails if an env file is tracked again. Local development reads `.env.local`.
- **Worker config:** `wrangler.jsonc` has `env.staging` (Worker `opencharterapp-staging`, staging project, `*-staging.openapphub.org`) and `env.production` (the existing Worker `opencharterapp`, so its secrets carry over; `charter.openapphub.org`). The top level is the self-hosted default with placeholders, and a different Worker name, so an old Git-connected build can't overwrite production. `scripts/worker-env.mjs` feeds an environment's public `VITE_*` values into the build.
- **Deploys:** `staging.yml` (push to `main`: migrate with seed once the runner exists, build, `wrangler deploy --env staging`; skips with a notice until staging is set up) and `release.yml` (owner only, type "production" to confirm, runs only from `main`: migrate, then build and deploy production; nothing deploys if migrations fail). Wrangler is pinned at 4.152.0 in both.
- **Security headers** on every rendered response (spec §10.1), in `src/server.ts` via `src/lib/security-headers.ts`: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, and a CSP allowing only the app, its Supabase project (API, websocket, storage images) and Google Fonts. `'unsafe-inline'` stays for scripts and styles, because TanStack Start's SSR writes inline hydration scripts; moving to per-request nonces is a later hardening step. Checked on a local Worker build: pages, the 404 page and client navigation work with no CSP violations. Static assets keep nitro's cache rule.
- **Old build tooling removed:** the old Vite config wrapper replaced by a plain `vite.config.ts` with the same plugins (Tailwind, tsconfig paths, TanStack Start with import protection, nitro `cloudflare-module`, React) and `lightningcss` as a direct dependency; the build's CSS is byte-identical. Removed: the preview sign-in broker (`previewAuthStorage.ts`), the old error reporting, the unused cron helper, the old hosts in the checkout origin allowlist, the old editor's folder, its entries in `bunfig.toml`, and its note in `AGENTS.md`. `drizzle/` and the pending-schema shims stay until steps 5 and 9 (the database tests and `check:migrations` still read them).

**Owner steps (step 3):**
1. **Cloudflare:** switch off the Git integration (Workers Builds) that deploys the `opencharterapp` Worker from `main`. From now on only `release.yml` deploys production.
2. **GitHub secrets:** `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Workers deploy permission) and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`; later `PROD_DATABASE_URL`, `STAGING_DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `PROD_REF`, `STAGING_REF`. Optionally protect the `production` GitHub environment with yourself as required reviewer.
3. **Staging Worker:** once staging exists, paste the staging project's **publishable** key into `wrangler.jsonc` → `env.staging` (both `REPLACE_WITH_STAGING_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` values; it's a public value, or ask an agent), (superseded 2026-11-10: staging is the `opencharterapp` Worker's preview of the `staging` branch, on the preview domain `charter.staging.openapphub.org`; previews get no production settings or secrets: their vars are the `previews` block in `wrangler.jsonc`, and Stripe payments there need `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `GATEWAY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (staging values) in the Workers Builds Preview base config).
4. **Production Worker:** add the custom domain `charter.openapphub.org`. Its secrets are already set.
5. **Old domain:** once Charter is live on `charter.openapphub.org`, redirect `opencharterapp.org` (and `www.`) there: Cloudflare → `opencharterapp.org` zone → Rules → Redirect Rules → "all incoming requests" → dynamic `concat("https://charter.openapphub.org", http.request.uri.path)`, status 301, preserve query string. Until then leave it; Supabase Auth's redirect URLs need both addresses during the switch.
6. **Local copies:** anyone with a clone that had the old tracked `.env` should rename it to `.env.local`.

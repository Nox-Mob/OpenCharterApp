# Testing and CI

Every change must keep all of these green (instructions.md §3). GitHub runs them in two workflows (D-197):

- **`ci.yml`, no live backend needed:** on every push to any branch, every pull request, every Monday (so new dependency advisories surface without a push) and on demand. Jobs: lint, formatting, types, unit tests and migration conventions; database rules; performance; dependency audit; build; and the docs check on pull requests.
- **`migrate.yml`, "Migrate" (owner only, by hand):** applies the vendored core and `db/migrations` to staging or production through `scripts/migrate.mjs` (dry run by default; secrets `STAGING_DATABASE_URL`, `PROD_DATABASE_URL`). The old `supabase-db.yml` replay and deploy and `supabase/migrations` are retired. On staging it also loads the demo data (`db/seed`, `--seed`): Charter's part of the suite demo (docs/demo-data.md), which OpenAppHub resets every 12 hours.
- **Deploys (spec §10.2, v2.2):** merging to `main` deploys production through Cloudflare's Git integration (`bun run build:hosted`). There are no deploy workflows; tests run in `ci.yml`.
- **`live.yml`, staging and the suite demo** (OpenAppHub's demo, reset every 12 hours; no secrets): on pushes to `main` and `BoardUpdates`, pull requests to `main`, daily at 06:41 UTC and on demand (Actions → Live demo checks → Run workflow). The smoke test (API) runs, then the end-to-end tests (Playwright on a local dev server pointed at staging), never two runs at once.

Repository settings, all optional: the variable `E2E_BASE_URL` (a deployed site, e.g. `https://opencharterapp.org`) to also run the checkout test on pushes to `main`, the daily run and manual runs. Branch protection, which makes these checks required before merging, is set by the repository owner (Settings → Branches).

| Check | Command | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | `bun run lint` | ESLint, including formatting through eslint-plugin-prettier |
| Formatting | `bun run format:check` | Prettier. Planning docs and generated files are excluded (`.prettierignore`) |
| Types | `bun run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit`, in strict mode |
| Unit tests | `bun run test` | Vitest. Pure rules live next to their code (`*.test.ts`) |
| Database rules | `TEST_DATABASE_URL=… bun run test:db` | Applies the vendored core (`db/core`) and `db/migrations` (schema `charter`) to a throwaway Postgres with `scripts/migrate.mjs`, each file in one transaction, and runs `db/tests/*.sql` |
| Migration conventions | `bun run check:migrations` | `db/migrations`: `NNNN_name.sql` names in order, tables only in schema `charter`, RLS on every table, a grant to `authenticated` (or a `-- no access` line for server-only tables) and a policy on every granted table, no `DROP TABLE` / `DROP COLUMN` (`scripts/migration-rules.ts`) |
| Build | `bun run build` | Production build |
| No env files | in `ci.yml` | Fails if any `.env*` other than `.env.example` is tracked (spec §7.1, D-219) |
| Security headers | `bun run test` (`src/lib/security-headers.test.ts`) | The four headers on rendered pages and the CSP's allowed hosts (spec §10.1, D-219) |
| Worker settings | `bun run test` (`scripts/worker-env.test.ts`) | `wrangler.jsonc`: production on the production project and suite domains, staging never on production, self-hosted default not hosted, no secrets in the file |
| Smoke test | `bun run test:smoke` | The suite demo and security rules on staging, without a browser (below). In `live.yml` |
| End to end | `bun run test:e2e` | Playwright against the live demo backend (D-170). In `live.yml`, after the smoke test |
| Dependency audit | `bun audit --audit-level=high` and `bun audit --production --audit-level=low` | Fails on a high or critical advisory anywhere, or any advisory in what ships to production. In CI |
| Docs check | `bash scripts/docs-check.sh origin/main` | Code or migrations changed without docs or tests (D-182). In CI on pull requests; label `no-docs-needed` to skip |
| Performance | `TEST_DATABASE_URL=… bun run test:perf` | Grows one roster in a throwaway database through 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 members (250 per chapter; `PERF_SIZES` to change, D-209), times the heavy reads at each size and fails if one is over `PERF_BUDGET_MS` (default 1000 ms, D-181; CI uses 3000 ms for its slower shared runners); also prints the security catalogue checks (`docs/security-review.md`). In CI |

## Pre-commit hook

Install once per clone with `bun run hooks:install` (it sets `core.hooksPath` to `.githooks`). Each commit then runs lint, formatting, types, migration rules and the unit tests related to the staged files (`vitest related`), and stops the commit if any fail (D-182). Database, build and end-to-end tests stay in CI. Never bypass it with `--no-verify`; if the hook is wrong, fix the hook.

## End-to-end tests

`bun run test:e2e` (Playwright, Chromium only, D-170) starts the dev server on `127.0.0.1:4310` **self-hosted (its own sign-in page) against staging**, with staging's public settings from `wrangler.jsonc` `env.staging` (no secrets), and drives the real screens signed in as the suite demo accounts (docs/demo-data.md): `demo@demo.openapphub.org`, who owns Riverside Community Association, and the empty `test@demo.openapphub.org`. The demo is reset every 12 hours. Specs live in `e2e/`; `e2e/helpers.ts` signs in through the real sign-in page.

| Spec | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `sign-in` | The demo account opens Riverside; the test account has no organization and can't open Riverside; a wrong password is refused |
| `members` | The Members tab lists every member (over 100) with standing, level and expiry; members are on different levels (Household, Individual, Senior, Student, Business Sponsor) and lengths (monthly, 1 and 2 years, lifetime); filtering by level and searching by name; a member's details |
| `navigation` | The organization's menu, with Settings' pages only once Settings is open (D-188); every section (Overview, Members, Board, Reports, Settings, levels, payments, board settings, audit log) opens without an error; the account page; the organization switcher on Riverside |
| `join` | The join page lists Riverside's levels (hosted joining needs an account, so it's signed in as the test account) |
| `google-sign-in` | "Continue with Google" goes to the project's Supabase Auth for Google and back to `/auth` (D-212) |
| `origin-guard` | A request to a site other than the app and its backend is blocked, while the app keeps working (D-186) |
| `a11y` | Every main screen, the organizations page, the account page, privacy and terms: every control has an accessible name, one main heading, a page language; sign-in by keyboard with visible focus (R2, D-183) |

The tests write nothing. The retired Demo National specs (user-testing guide steps, throwaway demo nationals, chapters and two-level dues) are in git history; the database tests still cover those rules.

Notes:
- **Features waiting for a migration** can only be tested end to end once staging has it (Migrate → `staging`). Add the spec in the same change.
- **Behind an outbound proxy** (some sandboxes), the browser uses `HTTPS_PROXY` for the backend and bypasses it for the local server.
- **Playwright is pinned to 1.64.1 and hardened (D-186):**
  - Import `test` and `expect` from `e2e/fixtures.ts`, never from `@playwright/test`. Its origin guard blocks every request to a host other than the app, the Supabase backend and the web fonts. Add a host for one run with `E2E_ALLOWED_HOSTS=host1,host2`. For a second page, use `guardedPage(browser, baseURL)`, not `browser.newPage()`.
  - Chromium's sandbox is on. It can't run as root: in a root-only sandbox, set `E2E_NO_SANDBOX=1`.
  - `E2E_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome` uses the installed Google Chrome instead of Playwright's bundled Chromium; CI does this.
  - Where Playwright's own Chromium build can't be installed, set `E2E_CHROMIUM_PATH` to an existing Chromium. In the Claude cloud sandbox: `E2E_NO_SANDBOX=1 E2E_CHROMIUM_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1243/chrome-linux64/chrome bun run test:e2e`.
- In CI the job uses the Google Chrome stable that GitHub's Ubuntu runners ship (and installs it with `playwright install --with-deps chrome` only when it's missing) and runs as a non-root user with the sandbox on. It uses the repository variable `E2E_BASE_URL` when set, except on pull requests: the deployed site runs `main`, not the pull request's code, so a pull request always tests a local dev server built from its own code (D-212). It uploads traces when a test fails.

## Live smoke test

In CI it runs in `live.yml` (see the top of this page). A receipt-numbering check looks only at the receipts issued during the run, because earlier runs' receipts are purged and leave gaps in the demo org's numbering.

`bun run test:smoke` runs against **staging** (openapphub-staging, settings from `wrangler.jsonc` `env.staging`) and the suite demo (OpenAppHub's `db/seed/0003_suite_demo_v2.sql`, reset every 12 hours). It signs in as `demo@demo.openapphub.org` and `test@demo.openapphub.org` (password `OpenAppHubDemo2026`, public by design) and checks through the API, with security rules on: the join page (signed in; signed out, hosted Charter refuses the API); that the owner sees Riverside Community Association with over 100 members, memberships, payments and receipts, its overview counts and its officers; that an admin can add a member record (removed again at the end); that clients can't write payments; and that the test account and signed-out visitors see none of it and can't add members. It records no payments (they are append-only; the database tests cover them). It needs staging seeded (the hub's `staging.yml`, then Migrate → `staging` here); no secrets. `SMOKE_SUPABASE_URL` / `SMOKE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` point it elsewhere. The retired Demo National smoke test is in git history.

End-to-end specs that need a home-chapter national (`guide-checks` §6.2, `lifecycle`) create a throwaway demo national and delete it afterwards, so they need only the demo accounts and orgs (D-212).

Because the demo national manages membership levels, the money flows run at Demo National; Austin is used for the parent-control, sibling-isolation and chapter-seat checks.

## Database rule tests

`scripts/db-test.sh` creates a fresh database named `charter_rules_test`, then:

1. Loads `db/ci/supabase-stub.sql`, a small stand-in for the managed `auth`, `storage` and `extensions` schemas and the `anon`, `authenticated` and `service_role` roles.
2. Applies `db/core` and `db/migrations` with `scripts/migrate.mjs`, each file in one transaction.
3. Runs each test file in `db/tests`. Each file runs inside one transaction that is rolled back at the end.

Helpers live in `db/tests/00_helpers.sql`:

- `tests.fixture()` builds a national with chapters A and B, a national admin, a chapter A admin, a chapter A member, and an outsider.
- `tests.as_user(uuid)` runs the next statements as that signed-in user, so RLS applies.
- `tests.throws(sql, text)` checks that a statement fails with the given message.
- `tests.eq(got, want, label)` compares two values.

**Never** point `TEST_DATABASE_URL` at the real project database. The script drops and recreates its own test database.

Current coverage:

| File | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `10_tenant_isolation` | Who can read what, downward-only inheritance |
| `20_write_rules` | Column grants, append-only audit, org creation rules |
| `30_invitations` | Single-use, email-bound, expiring invitations |
| `40_settings` | National locks |
| `50_roles` | Role assignment, last-admin protection |
| `60_attributes` | Typed validation, inheritance, member self-edit, chapter fields, locked chapter fields |
| `70_setup` | Permission checks, transactional apply, re-run, locks, chapter fields, membership levels |
| `80_custom_roles` | Custom roles: inheritance, no permission escalation, retire not delete |
| `95_memberships` | Term-end and standing rules (same cases as the TypeScript), member records without a login, recording joins and stacked renewals, payment permission, read isolation, no client writes, append-only history, approve / decline / cancel, grace from settings, claiming a record by invitation |
| `96_payments_gateway` | Test gateway limited to demo orgs (or the platform flag), Stripe credentials only sealed and only by payment managers, secrets and server-only functions unreachable by clients, connection visibility, webhook events claimed once, disconnect removes credentials |
| `97_joining` | Join info without signing in, starting a join (validation, nothing written but a pending payment), only the server role completes payments, duplicate and mismatched events, renewal stacking, failures, partial and full refunds, approval rules from the parent (D-130), claiming a record by paying, test checkout outcomes, decline with refund |
| `98_exports` | Exports audited with the exporter, row count and columns, permission and sibling checks, saved views (managers save, viewers read, isolation) |
| `99_privacy` | Directory shows only current, listed members with directory fields members may see; opting out / in / back to default; org default; outsiders and siblings refused; including opted-out members in exports needs the parent's permission |
| `9B_board` | Seats a national defines apply to its chapters, chapters add their own only when allowed, each chapter's own term with by-law history (append-only, term in force on the start date, "apply to current officers" logged), seat counts, good standing, the seat's role granted and revoked without touching a role held by hand, no escalation, history can't be changed or deleted, custom titles and the parent's rule, isolation |
| `9C_smoke_purge` | Only a demo-national admin may purge, and only in the demo orgs; the purge removes what a run created (payments with their receipts, memberships, seats, levels, profiles, roles) and keeps older demo data, other orgs and older audit entries; it records one summary audit event with the counts |
| `9D_setup_board` | Board setup through `apply_setup`: seats created and updated in place without duplicates, "used by" can change (widen to the org and its chapters, narrow back) but not while it would remove a current officer (D-157), no linked roles, the parent's "no extra seats" rule, each chapter's own terms with history and no duplicate rules, seats that don't apply refused, locked parent rules, permissions |
| `9E_rollups` | Roll-ups cover the org and its subtree with correct standing, new and expiring counts; totals match the detail rows; revenue excludes test, failed and out-of-range payments and nets refunds; vacant required seats and terms past their end; report exports audited; chapter admins and members refused for the national and siblings |
| `9F_two_level_dues` | Join page shows the two steps; joining a chapter without a national membership is refused; national first (pending), then the chapter (waits for the national); two payments and two receipts; the chapter can't approve before the national; with the national current a chapter payment activates at once; chapter price range on insert and update (national prices not limited); "no chapter dues" stops chapter levels |
| `9G_pricing_rules` | The shared pricing cases (ordered "at least", yes/no, one of, number, date, first rule wins, retired ignored, unknown values) as in `src/engines/rules/rules.test.ts`; quotes from stored values and answers; joining and renewal charge the member's price; rules checked when saved; the national's range; permissions; deletes remove nothing |
| `9H_demo_orgs` | Only platform operators create demo orgs, only at the top; chapters follow their parent; the flag can't be written by clients or flipped by anyone; test gateway and "no email" follow it; deleting refuses production orgs, chapters, wrong names and non-admins, removes the whole tree with its data, keeps accounts and records an audit event |
| `9I_board_scope_overview` | Seats used by the national and every org below it, each org filling its own; only nationals and regions may use it; changing a seat's scope (widen, narrow, refused while it would remove a current officer, owner only, audited); the governance roll-up counts it everywhere; overview numbers (chapters, people counted once, current and lifetime, chapter memberships, pending, new, expiring); a chapter admin sees only their chapter; members, outsiders and anon refused |
| `9J_seat_contacts` | Officers' own emails by default; a role email replaces them (never both), normalised and validated; a vacant seat with a role email is listed; clearing goes back to the officer's email; an officer without an email; only `governance.manage` at that org (not members, siblings, or seats that don't apply), no client writes, audited; profiles stay private to members; outsiders and anon refused |
| `9K_payments_export` | Payment export: the org alone or its tree, paid and refunded only, in range, refunds netted, test payments flagged, level / term / method / reference / receipt / tax treatment; emails only for member viewers; audited with the row count; chapter admins only their chapter; members, siblings and anon refused |
| `9L_home_chapter` | Home-chapter model: separate until chosen, only a national chooses, chosen once (no change or removal), at-large chapter must be its own; join-page info for anyone; the member picks, changes and clears their chapter (record reused, history kept, seats ended); chapter admins read the national membership and count the member in overview, reports and directory, then lose it after a move; officers must be current members of the chapter; national admins move records without a login; people counted once in the national's overview; no client writes to the link; history append-only |
| `9M_levels_standing_pricing` | National standing for a chapter's members (chapter admins only; members and siblings refused); suggested levels copied (independent) or linked (name, terms, prices and retirement follow the national; same, amount off and percent off, kept within the range); linked levels can't be edited directly; making a level the chapter's own; chapters without their own levels refused; the setup pricing step applied twice gives one rule, updated in place; unknown terms and callers without permission refused |
| `9N_rollup_performance` | After 0034: each membership still uses its own org's grace days in the members roll-up, overview and directory; the directory default and a member's own choice; permission checks unchanged |
| `9O_home_chapter_settings` | 0036 (D-184): below a home-chapter national a chapter can't add or restore membership levels, even if the old setting allows it; the national still can; other edits to an existing level still work |
| `9P_ready_for_real_use` | 0037: helpers refused to anonymous callers while join pages still work; remove from roster (permissions, yourself, hand-given roles, membership cancelled with the reason, member role removed, no longer a member, audited) and restore; import (every bad row reported and nothing written, preview writes nothing, applied membership, lifetime, fields, no payment invented, audited, re-running updates without duplicates, siblings refused); the audit log (permission, setup drafts hidden, names, references, transactions, no token hashes, only the org's own events); `sync_my_email` |
| `9Q_ready_for_real_use_home` | 0037 in the home-chapter model: only the national imports, a chapter needs a membership, members land in their chapter; chapter records can't be removed, and removing the national record takes them off both rosters and logs the chapter change |
| `9R_creator_not_a_chapter_member` | 0038: a new chapter has nobody on its roster and its creator still manages it from the national but isn't a member; a new national makes its creator a member and admin |
| `9U_scale_indexes` | 0044 (D-209): every foreign key on the tables that grow with the roster has an index; JIT is off for the six heavy report functions; the overview still answers and still refuses someone without `members.view` |
| `9S_overview_people_once` | 0040: in the home-chapter model the overview counts two members due for renewal as two people, not four records; chapter memberships still count chapter records |
| `9V_openapphub_core` | On the OpenAppHub core: every row carries the customer (`org_id`); core owner/admin hold `org_admin`'s permissions in the whole tree; a core viewer loses staff permissions; giving a staff role adds a core membership; read-only when the plan lapses, while payment paths still record; organizations from the hub open in Charter (`ensure_top_unit`); core invitations; deleting the core organization removes Charter's data; self-hosted join page open to anon |
| `9T_no_open_read_rules` | 0042: permission lists, role permissions and logos have no "everyone" read rule; logos need sign-in and access to the organization |
| `9A_receipts` | Receipt issued for each paid payment and frozen, numbering per org and year with no gaps, can't be changed or deleted, payer and admin access, void / issue again / reissue versions, partial and full refunds |
| `90_tiers` | Membership levels and terms: isolation, term rules, parent control, retire not delete (deletes remove nothing), identity columns can't change |

## Migrations not yet applied

Migrations are tested here before the owner applies them to the live database (`migrate.yml`). Until then:

- Types for them go in `src/lib/db/pending-schema.ts`, not the generated `types.ts`. Use the `db` client from there. A migration that only adds columns to an existing table can extend the generated table type there (see git history of that file for the `WithColumns` helper used for 0032).
- Screens that need them sit behind the readiness guard (`src/lib/db/readiness.ts`, `<RequiresDatabase>`). Add a feature entry with the migration name and a probe table or function.
- Add the migration to "Pending migrations" in `/roadmap.md`. Once applied (and `types.ts` regenerated by `gen-types.yml`), remove its section from `pending-schema.ts`, mark its readiness feature `applied: true` (no more probing), and mark the roadmap row applied. The regenerated types sometimes type a nullable argument as a plain string; send `null` through a small cast helper (`sqlNull`) in that case.
- With the generated types, every SQL argument without a default is required. Send `null` explicitly (never leave the argument out): PostgREST matches functions by argument names, so a missing one fails with PGRST202.

## Adding a test

- Put a new business rule as a pure function under `src/engines` or `src/modules`, with a `*.test.ts` next to it.
- Add a database test whenever a policy, grant, trigger or RPC changes.
- Tests that need WebCrypto (signatures, encryption) start with `// @vitest-environment node`.
- A user-facing flow also gets an end-to-end spec in `e2e/` (see above). It may only run once its migration is applied on staging.
- Component tests mock the Supabase client; when a query builder method is added (e.g. `.is()`, `.range()`), add it to the mocks that use that query.
- A new migration must also apply inside a single transaction; check with `psql -1 -f <file>` against a database with the earlier migrations.

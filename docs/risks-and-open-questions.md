# Risks and Open Questions

Review at each sprint review. Move resolved items into `decisions.md`.

## 1. Open questions

> Struck-through items were resolved in v6: Q-01 (person is global, D-036/D-037), Q-02 (region in the DB now, D-035), Q-03 (two Stripe modes, D-049), Q-04 (JSONB attributes, D-065).

Priority: **P1** = settle before database design. **P2** = settle before the owning epic starts. **P3** = can wait.

| ID | Pri | Question | Proposed default |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~Q-01~~ | ~~P1~~ | **Person identity.** Is a person global to the install with memberships per org, or scoped per national? (A person in two chapters, or in two different nationals on the hosted service, is the case that matters) | Global person per install. Memberships per org. Strict visibility rules so one national never sees another's data |
| ~~Q-02~~ | ~~P1~~ | **Region tier.** Schema-only support from day one, or leave it out until later? | Support in the hierarchy model from day one. Region-specific features come later |
| ~~Q-03~~ | ~~P1~~ | **Stripe connection model.** Stripe application fees require the national's account to act as the Connect platform with chapters as connected accounts. On the hosted service, who is the Connect platform? | See risk R-01. Support (a) Connect with national as platform, and (b) direct connection with no automatic national fee, fee handled by invoicing |
| ~~Q-04~~ | ~~P1~~ | **Attribute storage approach** (typed columns, JSONB, EAV) | JSONB driven by definitions, validated with Zod, with indexes. Prototype before committing |
| Q-18 | P2 | **Branding limits.** Allowed logo formats and sizes, whether chapters may also override colors, and whether a chapter can hide national's logo entirely | SVG, PNG, and JPEG within a size limit. Logo and colors overridable independently, national controls the mode |
| Q-19 | P2 | **Join-with-existing-account flow.** Proof of ownership when someone signs up for a second org with an email that already has an account | Require sign-in or email verification, never confirm account existence to an unauthenticated visitor |
| Q-05 | P2 | **Email sending identity.** Do orgs send from their own domain, or from a platform domain with reply-to? | Platform sender with the org name and reply-to by default, optional custom sender domain later |
| Q-06 | P2 | **Do all members get accounts?** Or can some exist as records only (for example, added by CSV, with no login until invited)? | Records first, accounts on invite or on self-signup claim |
| Q-07 | P2 | **Approval link confirmation.** Plain GET approval is unsafe because email scanners prefetch links. Is a confirmation page (one extra click, with the comment box) acceptable? | Yes. Link opens the confirmation page and the decision happens on submit |
| Q-08 | P2 | **Award appeals mechanics.** Appeal to whom, how many times, and within what window? Set by the owning org, but what options do we offer? | Appeal to a chosen higher level, one appeal, configurable window |
| Q-09 | P2 | **Who can nominate for awards?** Any member, officers only, or per award? | Per award setting |
| Q-10 | P2 | **Rank attribute scope.** One rank list per org, or can there be several (e.g., by branch)? | Attributes are generic, so an org can define several. Rules reference a specific attribute |
| Q-11 | P2 | **Member privacy defaults** for directory and exports, and the admin override policy | Org-level default, member-level preference, national decides whether admins can override |
| Q-12 | P2 | **Currency and locale.** USD and US tax only for v1? | Yes, but no hard-coded currency assumptions |
| Q-13 | P3 | **Name and branding** for the project | TBD |
| Q-14 | P3 | **Hosted tiers and thresholds** (chapters > 5, members < 100, and so on) | Remains configuration. Decide before E-42 |
| Q-15 | P3 | **Postpaid reminders cadence** defaults | Sensible platform defaults, edited via setup |
| Q-16 | P3 | **Accessibility target** (WCAG 2.1 AA) | Adopt as the target |
| Q-17 | P3 | **Data retention periods** for governance records, receipts, and audit logs | Retain indefinitely by default, org-configurable for non-financial data. Confirm legal requirements |

## 2. Risks

| ID | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-01 | **Stripe Connect and the national fee (mitigated by the two-mode decision D-049).** Application fees are collected by the Connect platform account. For a national fee to work, the national's Stripe account must be the platform, and each national would need to register as a Connect platform. On a multi-national hosted install, we are not the platform for them | National fee may not work automatically for every Stripe setup | Spike early. Offer two modes: Connect (national as platform, automatic fee) and direct (chapter's own account, fee settled by invoice). Keep fee logic behind the gateway abstraction |
| R-02 | **PayPal complexity.** Fee splitting and multi-party flows are harder than Stripe | Delays Phase 2 | Treat PayPal as a plain "chapter collects directly" adapter first. Fee by invoicing (F-07) |
| R-03 | **Tenant data leakage.** The highest-severity failure for this product | Loss of trust, legal exposure | RLS plus app checks, tenant-isolation tests required in the Definition of Done, review of every cross-org query |
| R-04 | **Scope size.** The feature set is large (Tendenci-class plus governance, elections, awards) | Never ships | Strict phases with demoable exit criteria. Shared engines built with their first consumer. Park future items explicitly |
| R-05 | **Generic engines over-built.** Attributes, rules, approvals, setup, and forms could become frameworks that outgrow their first use | Slow progress | Build the thinnest version that satisfies the first consumer, extend on the second |
| R-06 | **Setup engine drift.** Setup flows fall out of sync with the actual config screens | Confusing UX, bugs | Setup writes to the same records as admin screens, shared validation, flows tested end to end |
| R-07 | **Compliance correctness.** Receipts, tax treatment, and retention can have legal consequences | Wrong receipts for donors | Keep wording as configurable data, have a CPA or attorney review the defaults before release, immutable receipts with versioned corrections |
| R-08 | **Custom domain and TLS operations.** DNS verification, on-demand certificates, and abuse (someone pointing a domain they do not own) | Security and support burden | Verify ownership before issuing certificates, gate on-demand TLS with an allow-check endpoint, rate-limit |
| R-09 | **Email deliverability and approval links.** Bulk mail reputation, scanners hitting links, expired tokens | Missed approvals, spam placement | Confirmation page for actions, single-use expiring tokens, resend flows, SPF/DKIM guidance, escalation after silence |
| R-16 | **Late packaging.** Deferring Docker means deployment problems surface late | Painful first deploy | Keep config environment-driven from E-01, avoid host-specific features, and set an explicit trigger for pulling F-11 forward (before E-22, E-42, or the first shared test environment) | 
| R-10 | **Self-host support burden.** Free software with varied environments | Support cost | Single supported path (Docker Compose, built in F-11), clear docs, health checks, version upgrade notes |
| R-11 | **AGPL and hosting competition.** AGPL does not prevent others from offering hosting, it only requires source sharing for modified network-served versions | Revenue pressure | Compete on hosting quality and support. Revisit licensing with an attorney before first public release if this concern grows |
| R-12 | **Rank-based eligibility accuracy.** Approver rank depends on member-maintained or admin-maintained data | Wrong approvers | Rank verified flag by chapter president, national review, audit trail |
| R-13 | **Elections trust.** Admin-visible votes are accepted, but disputes still happen | Disputed outcomes | Immutable certified results, full audit trail, defined recount process, hybrid vote entry logged |
| R-15 | **Account enumeration and cross-org privacy.** A global account makes it possible to leak that an email exists, or that someone belongs to another org | Privacy breach | Uniform responses on sign-up and sign-in, no cross-org membership visibility in any admin screen or export, tests for it |
| R-14 | **Postpaid and standing edge cases.** Multiple levels with different rules can produce confusing overall standing | Wrong eligibility decisions | Define standing derivation clearly (which layers count is a national setting), test matrix of combinations |

## 3. Assumptions

- US-based organizations, English, USD for v1.
- Chapters generally have their own EIN or are covered under a group arrangement, and each receipt names the entity that received the payment.
- The majority of chapters have small admin teams, so setup and approvals must be simple and mobile-friendly.
- National manages award fulfillment in v1.
- Members usually belong to one chapter but may belong to several, and may hold both national and chapter membership.

## 4. Items needing outside review

- CPA or attorney: receipt wording and tax treatment defaults for 501(c)(19) and 501(c)(3), dues vs. donations treatment, quid pro quo disclosures.
- Attorney: AGPL implications for the hosted service, contributor terms, trademark for the project name.
- Security review before first production release: tenant isolation, signed links, credential storage.

## 5. Suggested first spikes (before or during Phase 0/1)

1. **Stripe Connect and application fee spike** (resolves R-01, Q-03).
2. **Tenant isolation prototype** with RLS and an org-and-descendants policy (resolves Q-F in `data-domains.md`).
3. **Attribute storage prototype** with filter, sort, export, and rule evaluation on 100k rows (resolves Q-04).
4. **Wildcard subdomain and on-demand TLS** with Caddy locally (supports E-07 and E-22). Wildcard resolution can be spiked with `*.localhost` first. The TLS part ties to F-11.

## Added 2026-10-30
- **R-20 Self-hosting (principle 6):** building on Lovable Cloud ties auth and jobs to managed services. Mitigation: keep business rules in SQL functions and `src/lib/policy`, so a self-host port replaces only adapters.
- **R-21 Logo lock enforcement:** today the "chapters may use their own logo" rule only hides the upload control. Resolution respects the lock, so the national logo still shows, but a chapter admin could still store a logo file. Revisit if this matters.
- **R-22 Demo data:** demo accounts and orgs exist in the live database (docs/demo-data.md). They must be removed before launch.
